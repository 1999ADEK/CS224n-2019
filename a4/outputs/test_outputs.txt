You know what I do is to write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for a kid, most read in the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can hold it as farmer, or with <unk> clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell into some place.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the complicated circle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of class.
When I went to bleed every week in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers room.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working on organizations that were fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> he said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we can never get to know us.
You could be <unk> to Ohio, and please bring that guy that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> <unk> and I'd like you to do this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were going to see us, <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, and we had it taken off and take it out of her family, because necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of cinders and put it in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you told you was actually done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked about this a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs a dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was trying to understand what was in front of me.
And I <unk> me around the water -- almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of glaciers or the ice booms are born.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to <unk> and hold up to the end, while others can't get more and they were <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, looking at a <unk> that are isolated separated and separated by themselves, as much as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As you melts in a <unk> I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As you melts in an iceberg it releases freshwater rich in minerals that feed a lot of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's quite often going to see an iceberg <unk>
Here it is.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk> iceberg in size.
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single child, a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too close to the details of conception, because if they stop to think about conception in yes, they're not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm goes together to the X X of the <unk>
And in the other case, the X X of sperm is joined the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and <unk>
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity in my ground, I have two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> of training, and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- you know, human bodies and <unk> how have the body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features are challenging social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with identical twins two people inside a single body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who are much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical typology is not fit in the male and conventional female <unk>
In lines, we can call them <unk>
<unk> embraces lots of ways.
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that's not <unk> in human or female, or <unk>
For example, the case is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which is called the <unk> gene, and it tells you the <unk> that we all have in the life of <unk> <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body is not reacting to the same.
It's <unk>
So, there's high testosterone levels but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops on a course of a female course.
When you get older, the baby is about a little bit of a girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not about puberty, when it's growing up and developing breast breast but doesn't have the menstrual cycle, when someone realizes something is happening.
After asking you tests that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think that this is a man, but it really isn't.
Women, like men, we have in the body -- something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a female woman -- doesn't know his <unk> structure, and I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> which has <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old <unk> born and raised as <unk> she had girlfriend, and sex with her, held a life as a kid, and I had just found out she had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had the 20th chromosomes and the <unk> the <unk> glands were so active that we essentially created a hormone hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component are typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19 when he started having a caused medical problems by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> -- they have tissue <unk> wrapped in tissue <unk>
We don't know what that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason children with these kinds of bodies are going to be <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> surgeries -- <unk> surgeries -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health of physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it was <unk> to various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that one particular anatomy brings into a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have an identity <unk> <unk> <unk> means having African anatomy in historic terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very sensitive ideas in our culture to the <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people in the same body.
The lowest case is last year with the South African <unk> South African <unk> put in fabric of judgment in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
Many journalists called to ask, "What a test are going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> between men and women and <unk> and women and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more of science, more we have to admit that these categories were -- we thought were kind of stable <unk> categories that are directly coupled with <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something which is much more complicated than the terminology of the <unk>
So as we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go through it in science we get increasingly in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very important discussions today on <unk> today, but I know inside the <unk> to when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to go through this question of whether somebody was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose and if she moved still not to <unk>
If I stopped moving through it.
But we can, for example, to draw vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And, as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma of actually somebody's death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I am progressive, at people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I got nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought I was interested in.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first of all, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan, of the Founding <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, I find myself every so much watching that music <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why it happened in <unk> with the Founding <unk>
The Founding <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as everyone believes -- what we do, our Founding <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming into the right of blood passed away from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The Founding <unk> rejected that idea and replace it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They set up the game field and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not <unk> differences, that was a very radical thing.
And partly they were doing it because they're part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
The democracy was <unk> and at the same time we get science.
And there is very clear, if you look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power <unk> being passed through a vague idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence and talk about nature and God from nature.
They don't talk about God and nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were spreading the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
<unk> women.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement to <unk> people from <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
And we found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement in saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people in color that are attributed to <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking for why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't mean that we should be able to figure it out.
I don't mean that the children of five were supposed to have sex or to get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they get them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two creatures -- at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine one of them, Mary, Mary, was born three months before time, June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born on the March one in March 1980.
By the fact that he was born three months before Mary was attributed to all three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent -- the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different age, but because it was born next.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, about virtue of being considered -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered to be considered by virtue of the compulsory <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on its part, don't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman in some states.
So it's still <unk> categories in various ways that are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science goes so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is going to be <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a kind of attitude we said, "Well, we have to draw the line in some part, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are caught in a rare position.
For example: Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man to have no <unk> and that to marry a woman has to have <unk>
Now in practice they don't make tests of <unk> to people.
But this is also very strange because the story I told you at the beginning of the <unk> of <unk>
So if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I would serve <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, this idea looks pretty good."
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do people judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on the rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know you can make more decisions and intelligent decisions about their sex relationships than 40 I know.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this kind of thoughts in relation to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed -- unless you're willing to submit to a sex change in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple years ago that he had done to give birth twins <unk> to then pick them up, and so they <unk> his name.
But when I asked her phone why the operation was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change for the right state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be like democracy, or it might have been, if we had given more participation at the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit of radical for a feminist, which is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking in a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual differences.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and engage in those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- <unk> considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has feminine <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking <unk> of gender, so there's nothing feminine in the <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, the more I think about your question, has something like something that has something feminine <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> of complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So as well as parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that they have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we get democracy beyond <unk> thinking less on the individual body, in terms of identity, and to think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think of what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to be <unk> how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work on, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we are far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to make a city.
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than the cost of construction.
So we could easily break it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But we just put together by buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments already can be owners and the other half still left to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to increase <unk> in all of the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are around them have rules to avoid <unk> and make distractions for construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new place, building a completely new apartment building a completely new apartment building, and when the norms of that place would turn off the construction rather than putting <unk>
So I suggested that the governments to bring up new reform areas for large enough to contain cities and gave them a name: cities.
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75 <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis. <unk>
In the next <unk> elections -- <unk> <unk> became <unk> with a platform in which we have reforms, and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> he was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error.
The first point was the importance of the rules, as those rules that say you can't go and pick up all the current residents of apartments.
And so we have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies as a lot of rules of rules, and they are usually the rules that prevent us to move forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him a link with the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December in December we came together in Miami in a conference room from a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are much more valuable than their cost to <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the ground in a place like New York City terrain that, in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a rather abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk describing in terms of very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called me and told me that we had to do this project, this could be important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about again the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport is covering over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince you that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world is <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The leader of the Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained what we found that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city where you could go in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government, you would need help from the countries that could benefit from the countries that they could help them establish and make the <unk> norms so that everybody could rely on that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw the site.
This picture is there.
It could take a bit of a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement to allow us to create these special regions of development.
In a country that just passed through this <unk> crisis in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All of them are all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17th, once in a kind of <unk> voting on one.
Immediately after the voting in the 21st of February, the <unk> of about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building construction.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that is building in Korea, it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country in the building of cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow <unk> to <unk> and they would allow it to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow the Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban and builders, cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of businesses that they want to go into the <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family behind their family to get them to get them to get them to get them to get them and make the money that have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some of them in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a dozen of these around the world?
What does it look like to think about insist so that families can choose between several cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you a TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to do a public confession and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog suits and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
<unk> stores, let me reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> and I think it's <unk> and buy it become my personal search for <unk>
That is, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
<unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was talking about for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does anybody have that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I could suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
And inside it for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know like the woman who walks at TED in <unk>  --  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Doesn't it sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this brilliant tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see a phenomenal amount of 50 dollars.
All of the together, including the <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be out of bad humor, when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you will also tell you.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remember your <unk>
I like to call it, and say, <unk>
<unk> is the key.
If you think you look good with something, it's pretty much sure you are.
And if you think you don't see it well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inner and outside, you don't look at that <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth to you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
And I've tested it again and again when people approached me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously, this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, and I am going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave back certain things.
I don't need to have emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy crazy, <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I'm looking at.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, the left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each other, we could design a plane of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you turn your brain into this scale?
Some <unk> on one of these extremes, but I think that for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> of both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, as well as most of the other quantum quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make experiments really work.
How did we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
In a single intuition that you can have developed over the step of the years is what it says that one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing on a parking bar.
It was a little kid, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that play playing that bar with that parking lot taught a precious lesson, and that is that big things don't allow them to be able to get them and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a physicist of particles.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don't play with parking bars and play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of really odd things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years since, you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe because they don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But I didn't fit it well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it should not be all following the principles of quantum mechanics ...
I find the reason why it didn't have been.
And so I'd feel so much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been on an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then we do a very large approach, the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal little little bit of a springboard and that <unk> against a platform.
And then I did this almost as the same way that you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a chip of silicon and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this bore hole in a form of swimming <unk> that's underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be on a quantum overlap but for it a bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up and get out of doing those things, because I don't want them to tell you, or, actually, let's get it.
quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave the same way.
<unk> trip of inanimate objects are not just people -- it's also the light that <unk> and the wind goes on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal and to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then they put it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way he <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that's expanding and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth thrust, and we were able to make it <unk> and that not <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing is not going to be at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
Because the <unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you can't too?
I mean, this is my logical part that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we cut it up, and we turned the lights up and we looked at the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about a lot about that quantum mechanics made everything interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my chief who's here and that allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months and so.
A lot of negotiations and stories, we had it <unk> with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explains just on this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
It was a great education -- I don't know, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
Best to show you the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from his launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the round gallery at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> -- Van <unk>
In fact, I'm going to get into one of my favorites, in the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click on and, we click on, we are now inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you get <unk>
They want to navigate through the <unk>
We open up the plane. And with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside that you want to go at the end of the stream.
We're still going forward. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on this right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the technology <unk>
So this image, for example, I believe, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get to 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really do with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to get it out.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a minute, this seems <unk>
I walked in, and I found that the children were actually playing with something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I learned something about it.
And now we're going to get further into the depth and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the image, so you'll really see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump back again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this work."
It goes up and they really do it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this frame, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night -- I think I had never seen it so before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite features.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same way.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just made a zooming around you.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, I think, even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium to make the work of art and that is represented online online.
And the big question I'm doing today is: "You have done this to replicate the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it a <unk> an pixel called a <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm of Italian, all the kids in Italy grow this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened to have happened really interesting in the year of year of year of year of year of year of year in the last two decades.
Some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of year -- one, take a budget and get it to a good pilot and a good car ...
And if the car and the pilot was good enough, you earned the race.
This is what we have in engineering, it will be <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
The interesting thing is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming an outdoor <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a story note, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet but represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are coming into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's as if almost all of the existing atoms were coming into sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a certain sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo got rid of <unk> the <unk> says that at the end he took the hammer and he was threw down the Moses -- you can still still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> non <unk> -- and why not <unk>
Well, today, our first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and create something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years ago, in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they were played by Italy and France, and at the end of <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I got Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity of <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The top line is at the top.
So early on, there are people over here and doing this?
It starts to be silent.
<unk> of France.
<unk> people do a quick call and they go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They earn Italy, yeah!
That night all of them were to join the center.
There you see the great peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winner and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people will be <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but the things we use and we consume.
Today we know everything about the source of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how it gets off.
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle just a little more than a year ago, to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be able to see, things that would be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening things complicated and there's a lot of transport.
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that <unk> not simply -- is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that you cut on one day is still still there.
If we show them to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and lots of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked to at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us to Spain and south Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> tubes, <unk> <unk> <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with water.
If you follow the missing pixels on them, you can write patterns, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can go through the image.
We presented this to the Mayor <unk>
They liked it a lot.
And I took a commission to design the entrance to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There's no windows or no windows, but when you come up with it open so you can actually happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter when the roof goes down, somebody who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they've been <unk> but when it comes down almost all the architecture away.
Here it is working.
You see people <unk> so it goes in.
And here I am right here trying to do not to try and test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you go, but a building that was still making <unk> and holes in the water, and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things for it, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the water pixels and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air, and each one had a small pixel that would change color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like what we saw earlier, moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, this cloud,
It's a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration like this in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, the one that changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play it with a different guy.
Imagine that the display appears on different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And that then could all have a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get close and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet dancers today, the star of New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture its 3D movement and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left-hand side, you see the <unk> <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can catch all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the missing pixels with them, we can play with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input to the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our <unk> environment, like an oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think that what has happened in the last two decades, is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign will <unk> we can go from the digital world, of the self-organizing power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this might we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or emissions of CO2. How do you go from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people engaged in doing this together, in the collective form.
The cloud is a <unk> again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered the pixels.
You can move around with a different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it's to be able to share the main moments of the London Olympics.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up as a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody who is going to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could improve it for a more accurate accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in a better way, get more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of ourselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What's the most passionate about?
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do we love creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably should be the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Oh, most of them. That makes me feel pretty well as a doctor.
If you could have something like this, the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that possible?
Evolution has been an ongoing theme here at the TED Conference.
The great section of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called <unk> in biology, makes sense of the light of the <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Take the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is of course, the most interested in it.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In spending there have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk>
It might seem to be very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it is the same protein, it's chemically <unk> that comes out of the <unk>
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in our gut and more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> asks you about the <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm hot, wet, <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want without effort.
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional occasional rush of uninterrupted <unk>
But, on the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or was destined to become something different, which is perhaps <unk> <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only one and only human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I was first <unk> college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the operating organisms, every cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two remaining cells.
But when organisms come together, things start to change.
The sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the death of the death of the body enters evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still landed in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits his front door.
He opens the door.
In front of him he finds a slight dancing <unk>
He looks at it and says, <unk> it looks for a <unk> <unk>
"He's <unk> he says, George, <unk> <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be healthy.
I wanted to recover health in disease.
I wanted it to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of turning the genome to the next <unk> adapt and generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and you are kind of like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us drop the sea.
I think all of us will take the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get competition through my work.
I want to be <unk> I don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily use longevity.
It doesn't necessarily use the biggest or the stronger or the strongest and even the most clever.
Evolution encourages creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that they can survive if there were fish there, which would be added fish in empty fish, yet they've managed to make that an inorganic environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward, at the <unk> phase, I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying aspect would be that through medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and written from the population.
And secondly, as we have -- we have <unk> our environment so that we fit to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we have <unk> and we get so excited that it's no longer possible to have the isolation necessary to make evolution.
A second possibility is that we have an evolution of the natural <unk> natural <unk> by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when we have a sort of <unk> planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility -- intriguing and scary possibility.
I call that <unk> new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals who are in the <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society but it's what it chooses to individual and familiar ones.
Just think that if you could be able to choose not only to choose not only to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make genetic settings or prevent diseases.
What if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and she was <unk>
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of course, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion bases of the human genome at a cost near 20,000 and on a week.
Not much so much to make the human genome actually make the human genome -- and being increasingly in the end of all of you.
Those are the changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can do viruses that are not just going to protect us but are going to induce us to be able to protect other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course with the vaccine against <unk> <unk> in cells from a plant plant.
Can you imagine something nice to go out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, to remove the diabetes, remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases to prevent diseases that will allow us to also adopt <unk> to better memory.
Why do I not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you were able to put it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a lasting <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next hundred years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices for a better society, more importantly, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about with flight.
So immediately I looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already taken off the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
Do you have the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and no <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words that you have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight flight.
I was able to see it in her eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it all changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't, all the fences I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I was a phrase, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to set it up.
I don't want to have anything in life.
And that urgency, that life has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I took the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes have been trying to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that you would play in things that didn't matter with people that do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And after, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please make me go.
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I went on, I had the feeling of, Wow, I will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadly <unk> in one thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> as a kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason for being the world.
At that point, I understood that when we connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
Especially the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave myself another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You know, you're flying around today, the challenge that you think that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how do you do?"
What is it that you are trying to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to his home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a total paralysis, today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation and so that is obviously how graffiti is a really intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and his cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "We just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and he will be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "Wait a second, it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can be able to communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and having a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they will mark with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check and rather than that a check that had no idea how he was going to <unk>
I teamed up with his brother and his father there at that precise moment, <unk> okay, this is the Tony <unk> going to talk -- we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on your inner cannot be able to do it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- you draw on that and register the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and, in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, close to a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization will move the things on one side to another we've achieved a couple of things.
One is to touch the gates of the insurance companies and we got a machine to be able to <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call her <unk> because when I talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all over the surrounding world of all the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they finished, they would have taken off the pieces of the walls and in their place would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we were going to go to the <unk> journey, my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of New <unk> <unk> that we bought on the street ride from <unk> Beach, some copper copper and <unk> Radio <unk>
We took a camera -- the <unk> we put it on a light of LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds up, we published the code <unk> the software is low in a free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There's no hospital that you can say "No."
Any person with paralysis, today has access to drawing and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the other person, and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of designing intense sessions all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot from the hospital.
And he went to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take in the parking lot as well as we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
And at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and somebody finally came to me, and they would get me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of an Blank.
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to move and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
It all comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends of closing <unk> is that in April <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles -- there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> urban art.
<unk> is going to be at the show, which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
Nothing that there is in this room that was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do you go through it, anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something, and I was excited with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want all of us to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel that you need to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who is not me.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations generally very hard and at the same time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
<unk> in <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this -- fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in much of my career I've been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal to treat.
So when I learned that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What there was the following, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and the content I have no idea what it is and the content I could do with the face, especially if I put it on a ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said this, it's a very good chance to be <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you'd have asked me a year ago, I couldn't have been able to afford to certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten into horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be made for something that is so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that is about <unk> products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film would be filled with <unk> of marketing and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The biggest film ever before.
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all from top up at the bottom, end, it has pictures of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the brand X.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were committed to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of the X <unk> in the title, but we're going to make sure that we use all the categories that we can on the film.
Maybe you put a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe that you've <unk>
The most cool car that you've driven in "The biggest <unk> in "The biggest drop than you have <unk> <unk> from "The biggest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is about transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea -- all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that. It's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> I don't know how to <unk> it will be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> -- but you know how it's going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money does it have to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be hard for the meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be <unk> to convince a couple of big Great.
<unk> who knows, maybe for the time that the movie is going to look at us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the responses will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> this film or being I?
JK: So two things.
MS: It means you're not very optimistic.
So, I need to me. I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk>
MK: We need to think about how brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation outside of it.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of us wanted to have nothing to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to cause as many people to see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea with that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had an error -- and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for pictures of <unk> in Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that showed up.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey -- No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> simulation or easily detected <unk> or easily <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices -- being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even the <unk> the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives you transparency --  like that weird bear that still continues to go.
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We had an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want them to be able to tell us <unk>
We want them to make a story, but we want it to be <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and that's him looking at me as a single <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in history.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> for many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off the proxy and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to look at all of a sudden -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies that the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends who make big, big, giant giant films and others who make these small, <unk> films like mine.
And my friends who make movies of big Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies have so much success is due to the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You get a little bit nervous.
I want to help you get <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before <unk>
And there we offer one of these <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a <unk> solid, <unk> to <unk> to <unk>
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a little <unk>
<unk> to the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are more good at <unk>
So we don't have the budget that other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people to be the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you better time? With better <unk> three times more cool.
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common type of <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, so many gray colors and things like that.
It's usually wearing light sunglasses, or I like the crystals and the like.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: I just call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: We're partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
We have toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Uh, <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand of Tom, but I often sit down at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that kind of brand.
If they were able to do it for them, surely they could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of your being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> of that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world in which you get to you, like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you do.
All those things come out and start in a place and start in my case and start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like things weird -- I like the weird things.
A: <unk> for the <unk> for what is that?
What is the <unk> What is the <unk>
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more than you, not who you are.
What other <unk> have <unk>
You don't have to be frightened. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.
A: thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> A: Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness on this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but <unk> on your personality of <unk> your brand, Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost an paradox in them.
And I think that some companies are only attached to one of their strong dots or in the other rather than focus on both.
Many companies tend to be -- and it's nature -- to avoid the things that they're not <unk> to avoid the things that they are not <unk> they are able to accommodate and make them become a positive piece for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classic <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are all playful marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come from, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you, your brand, your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more good to be <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like playful to be playful to be fresh as <unk> contemporary <unk> hacker, like <unk> <unk> fast or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical as <unk>
Or are you rather rather than <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
Are you <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>
You're reliable stable, stable, familiar, sure, safe, sacred, or wise like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the end product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we now use MRI to identify the MRI centers in the brain so much for commercial marketing as well as film.
We went to San Petersburg, where they've banned our advertising open.
Throughout the city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where businesses are getting into their way in schools with money problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects of which I've had the most successful answer or the ones that I've had more successful are the ones I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to think of people, who will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They were going <unk>
Well, since the movie was sent in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
In <unk> the movie was sent in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just about a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
He's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies that we talk about is giving their customers not a part.
I have always believed that if you get a risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you take people out of that pushing them into failure.
I think when you trains their employees in loss of <unk> they are preparing their entire company for reward <unk>
I feel like what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, to move on, I think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. Get the risk.
From one <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Today than never a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who were bought by <unk> bought the rights of name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: And so I was in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> computing worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset for developing nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we are able to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software of <unk> they're from a completely different technology.
But if we can put an effective virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, so we're ready.
This is the <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> enters the gray box, damaging the <unk> and the nuclear nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> <unk> <unk> multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes -- these control systems.
So that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we would put together our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they had very odd things.
<unk> were <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And then from experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that location.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It could be, let's say for example, a U.S. power plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So pulled out the seizure code, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs a small one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much they were, the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech <unk> let me say the load is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at initially was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to meet it with the real world with real potential goals.
We need <unk> theories that we can pass or <unk>
To get to the theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white <unk> and you probably located in Iran, because it's where most infection has been hacked.
There are several thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the <unk> plant plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants among our <unk>
I called them and I was reminded of an effort to make it out of their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
The rotor is that little cell part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the heart goal was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at very close to data and structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't get it.
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
So that wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been there after several weeks of hard work.
We have to go back in dead ends, and we had to go back to begin.
Yet, we found that both digital <unk> was to one single single thing and itself, but from different perspectives.
<unk> <unk> is taking a <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry that other targets are <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- really <unk> me.
There's the gray box, and you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input of input of sensors for example, from the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> which is still running during attack, with false data data.
And believe it or not, this <unk> data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed by video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act quickly.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine goes from speed, you have to open off escape <unk>
Obviously, this can't do a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could also work too, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this load with a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
It will make the more possible.
And if you made that, with what you're going to do, it's a mass of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and so much better than we begin to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assumed the <unk> is the main contribution behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower
There's one story, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because in another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give them <unk> or another one to do that you can do your wheelchair users and get up and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that you put in the morning, it gives you a big strength, which is also increasing your speed, and help you for example, how to handle it.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can do it and connect it with the universe and with other remarkable things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working with, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back to a <unk> <unk> and it's being paid to get even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to consider this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or -- or <unk> What's Universal superheroes.
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can take it 90 percent of pounds through variables for many hours.
Its flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it goes up my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back now looking back into the users of the wheels, which I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people, and so on the rest of the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens to often, very young people, with the damage on the spinal cord that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- <unk> against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
We also talk about the population that is getting missing quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago that he had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals on board, here on the back.
There's also a few batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and at the knees, and they make it move up with this soft, very nature.
AB: I had 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a stranger jump in the air, skiing down the bottom of it <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost every feeling and all of <unk> <unk>
Shortly after, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs <unk> it costs the rocks and even ride on a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of chairs from the wheels, all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hi, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious about it.
And no, it's not the festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of forests in Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their living relatives alive.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where the mortal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the Amazon rainforest and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been taken for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as World War I.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the Bonobo.
Local meat trade and deforestation are doing that you can't fill in or a stadium with the bonobos that left the world -- honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know that as the apes <unk> the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> to handle conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play all over their lifetime.
Play is not just a child's play.
For us, the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobos you see the roots of their laughter, the dance and the human ritual, <unk>
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game and I'm not talking about football.
Here's a female and a male male and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what he is doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have a <unk> of <unk>
I just believe that in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as much in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because you get this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where wonder.
And I want you to tell you, this is <unk> a young female who is playing with perceived water.
I think that like her, we sometimes play by alone, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a more and harder world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let me peak our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems the less appropriate to play, you can be the most urgent moments of it.
So with that, fellow primates, this gift of evolution and play together as we <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible for an development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of captain in a volunteers.
And in our city, where the volunteers allies a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career on the foot against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> it was <unk> in a conversation with the owner who certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing out in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and her house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  he came first to the captain and he was asked to go into and would save the owner of his owner again.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, for the rest of his life, would have to tell the people that I walked into a <unk> building just to save a live thing, because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need between the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> fire, and bring this woman a couple shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but I was able to put up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the <unk> firemen that in that height or less had to turn out the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back on the ladder where I met my <unk> and the precious dog on the front door.
I put my house home treasures for the owner of home where, as you would expect her treasure.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from her home owner by the brave <unk> effort to save her house.
The kindness that she watched on the other was that someone had gotten even a couple of shoes.
Both on my calling in Robin <unk> like on my calling as voluntary fireman -- I'm witness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at in this room to people who have succeeded, or are by <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you to remind you this.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you're right now.
They had food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but each day we can influence someone's life.
So they enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the particular block.
The first concrete blocks made in <unk> with a very simple idea, cement modules in a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most <unk> construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, we came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the building blocks came to every home.
It's estimated that there have been more than 400 billion or 75 billion bricks or every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block, the <unk> in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in Bell labs, the next revolution was now about <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> stacked from each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex, one brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just to experts.
I would personally have to do that -- that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best of everything is that they're linked by magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a code colors.
The green is the stream, the blue is the stream, the pink input and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue one with a green one, and very quickly you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue one with a green make light.
Can we put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, that is here, and now we have a light <unk>
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, and connect and <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make <unk> faster or slower, you just turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world <unk> to use ready to use.
<unk> sounds, panels, solar panels, it all must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a night light, or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers have no experience in electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> -- a few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers from the Rhode Island School designers who have no expertise in engineering, just in cardboard, and so we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> barrel on motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which has a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to the end of all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go on the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to tell you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is to get involved with the environment in the environment.
Industrial collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
We can continue to get the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I really term time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like some <unk> Peace <unk>
We took some members every year and we put them together with the <unk>
Instead of getting them to the Third World we send them into wild world.
They made large <unk> they worked with <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it comes up as if I was looking for a date, but what really looks for is that somebody has to clean up the snow because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did they get to ask for help in this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time, I was going on a long year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accepts <unk> when you <unk>
And when you do that, you put a name, in this case, he put him up.
If you don't, somebody can be <unk>
So, it has a component with a humanity.
It's a modest application.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But something that no other technology of the government <unk> technology.
And it extends into viral form.
A responsible for <unk> city systems -- to see this app that was able to use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to get <unk>
It's very important that they work out these <unk> <unk> but people steal their batteries.
That's why citizens are asking for the citizens.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to get people to get together to clean sidewalks up when she <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that are using using it.
And this has been spread out in organic and natural ways.
If you know a little government technology, you know this doesn't happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool so that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done for normal waterways would have taken at least two years ago and two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the California State of California that even the time has reached 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that was program in a couple of days -- and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests to the better ways of working, not as in private companies, as a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in form open, <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution -- but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we are building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people across the country that they contribute with <unk> applications, every day in their own communities.
They've not given up with government.
Do you feel a great frustration to that, but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we stop side, the feelings about politics, that line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that put us nuts, the government is, essentially, in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because we don't get <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to fix it, because things are changing.
The policy is not <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, about <unk>
This is the center of health care center, and services and information.
It's the place that serves the phone calls if you mark it <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> This call.
He entered the foundation of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And then finally, he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and I'm going to get a strong music and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a center center.
It has an <unk> web and cell phone called <unk> <unk>
We didn't get that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened, comes this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking to you.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so you all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went up to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government for collaboration in distributed competition.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform so that people will be <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And it might have connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, we get the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people are going to get it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, we sometimes spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will take our values and make our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like an immense ocean, and politics is the surface layer <unk>
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it is that <unk> which keeps us that that belongs to us that we actually founded as something that is operating on our against, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real job work happens.
We have to collaborate with the government machine.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk>
It's a bunch of citizen worried that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages of 325 pages in response to the order of the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> in the government, is time to ask us what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we have to go and go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of all?
We can't do with government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible in root to root our government function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> only to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am an older generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost by granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everyone will talk.
They can express your opinions at any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem you don't really care about making your voices a lot.
They're using your hands.
They bring hands into the work to program apps that make better for the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking out <unk> dumping a garbage garbage inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, we're not just consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we didn't get <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all of us together, will be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are being said here have an impact on the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning in it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice, my job.
I learned about my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> -- dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in any discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
He was daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was tough, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and I watched her, she was approaching me, and I was giving me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then I got off.
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> and he was approaching me, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I would get me back again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that made you always wish to be near it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the age of 10.
Instead, when I was going to spend a time with it, it was not easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins was running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first, I thought it was a game.
And so he looked at him and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, went down through the room, and he said, "Come on, <unk> The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> will tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> <unk> I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Only I want you to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want to tell you is that we always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> you know, <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want to tell you, is that you're always going to get the right thing to do the right thing, but the right thing to do.
And I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
Then, eventually he said, "All the third thing I want you to tell me is that I never want to be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> you know?
I grew up in the field, in rural South, I have a brother a older year and a younger sister.
When I was 14, 15, 15, one day my brother came home with a six <unk> package I don't know where I took her to my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just got to do the <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, she offered my sister, she took a little bit of me and was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. You don't. All right, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> today -- and you always do the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me at me.
And he said, "What happens to you? Take a <unk>
He looked at me with strength and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this will be <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I mean by the power that the identity has about identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should have a <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than 40 years ago.
In <unk> there was <unk>
Today there are 2.3 million here.
In America we have the largest <unk> rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my view, has changed our world.
In the poor or poor communities, you find so much <unk> as much despair.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, St. Philadelphia, UMBC, in 50 to 60 percent of all young people in color are in jail or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is so much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is affecting the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not ours.
We are <unk>
I think this is interesting.
We are looking at our work as well curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you call you rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the black population has lost the right to vote.
And if you put it over to the next 10 years the level of loss of a loss of rights to be as high as it was before it <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The U.S. is the only country of the world where it was sentence for 13 years to die in prison.
We have this country prison for children, without the possibility of coming out.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people at the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, they've told us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by the <unk> crimes, but if we deserve kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the U.S. is defined by error.
Out of every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent and liberated from death row from death.
An innocent rate of error, an innocent from every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not allow you to fly airplanes if from every nine to <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve killing.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about history <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk about terror, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted until World War II.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
It worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what his lives defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, you tell people to stop saying that in our history in our history with the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of that racial and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we put together with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage us with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome gender <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's pretty much disturbing to listen to what you would do.
<unk> "We don't have death row in Germany.
We will never have it here."
The room stayed silently and a lady said, "There's no way that with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational to be irrational and <unk> we could put the people."
Let's get on this thing.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very hard issues, the positive and the positive things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are embedded by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
Of course we talk about the need for more hope, more engagement, more <unk> with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the people who will never come to TED.
Think about them -- in a way, something that is inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues we've never seen.
So we are. Even though we are so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, so rational, as well.
So with innovation, the development of creativity. is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas as well by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives you to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in place in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to truly be human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, the injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity, than if we know these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege being a young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady called me to me, to say, <unk> comes Mrs. <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and get it.
I would say, "I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I <unk> <unk>
So I was going and I was going to give them the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks turned to me and said, "Now, my <unk> tell me this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my address.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We tried to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We tried to reduce the population in prisons.
We tried to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> put his finger on the face and said, "Is it why you have to be very much -- but very <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find a way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and to believe that each one of us is higher than the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lying, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't blame you, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
And so I think there's a basic dignity in the people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very exhilarating, very exhilarating, <unk> we don't judge for our technology, because of our designs, not for our intellectual or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way that they treat the rich and powerful people, but the way they treat the poor, they sell them to prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
I sometimes make a lot of force.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years, who have been <unk> so that they were adults who were adults themselves.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge have to turn someone out of what it doesn't is?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night I was very late at night -- my God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for something about that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think of it correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a little, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> <unk> is treated like a <unk> 98 years of a <unk>
In <unk> I put that there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there's no ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking about that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or actually <unk>
For my horror, I was not only <unk> it had sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally dropped out of the car walking at the court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man -- was the dawn of court.
When he looked at me and he said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He <unk> "It's <unk> I said yes.
And so I walked up and went on to me.
And I was interested in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
That's deeply attached to me, with my identity with the ability we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> and we started deceptive.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The cops came, the prosecutors <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was filled with people. All right, because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I had to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would just look at the window and you try and hear all that <unk>
It would be walking around here and for there.
Finally, this old black <unk> with a head of concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge judge a <unk>
During the break of the <unk> he showed upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> on the old black <unk>
He said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black man stood up, I looked at the <unk> I looked at me, and he said, <unk> this guy in <unk> to tell this young woman who maintain her view on the target with <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> at <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all of all, those of us here who share this, I just want to tell you to keep your eyes on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, on this community, to help in your purposes, doing something.
Something that's not a check.
<unk> There are several opportunities around you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to make an effort to give us the funds that are spent today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars worth of death penalty over the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases of homicide in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to come and get the law to the security.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decrease in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you what you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong <unk> war.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population <unk>
And we were letting us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people down to the supply chain, to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you have excited about here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: Let's put the threats by Bin Bin Laden.
<unk> 2: <unk> in Somalia. <unk> 3: The police throw away O.C. gas.
<unk> 4: <unk> <unk> 5: 5: Go!
<unk> added, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 9: <unk> 9: <unk>
Several <unk> War on the <unk> massive destruction.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> Death <unk>
Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be over the last six days or for the last six years.
The idea is that media would prefer <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our day our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can be solved.
And as nothing else cares about to survive, the first stop of all of this data is an old clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the <unk>
<unk> and records all of the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
And so from a bunch of stories of stories would look at the negative.
That old saying, "If there are blood blood, you're very true.
And because of all digital devices give us negative news for the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world will be wrong with worse.
But maybe it wouldn't be.
Maybe instead, what happens is we get <unk>
Maybe progress in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good issues -- climate change, extinction of species, the lack of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at overcoming the problems, and we just ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average per capita income has been <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food food, electricity and communications, has dropped from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people would do it.
And we continue to follow more and higher expectations.
In fact, we <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So a lot of this is technology and lately, this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that I would take on information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law is Moore, and doubling the price of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer for the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the smooth thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in the recession in depression and <unk>
It's the outcome of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop in any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is getting faster.
And on this curve, it's <unk> of Moore's Law -- there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computer in the cloud, my friends of <unk> call infinite computing, sensors and the ability to democratize and personalized personalized production -- the ability to democratize which across the planet, synthetic biology, fuels and food food, the digital medicine and <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> for humans."
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
He plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all on the cell phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, which can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can actually impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single day, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that's short and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he did something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
It was <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
This is not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated per capita per capita per capita per capita versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that by the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents in national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have plenty of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager Voyager into the Earth, in 1990, after he passed <unk>
Let's take a famous picture, how do you look like?
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, <unk> two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator size.
It's able to generate 1,000 liters of drinking water to the day of any <unk> saltwater, <unk> water <unk> by less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that I will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than the Reagan President 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart phone with Google, he has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance and communication that nobody could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, libraries of books and music, diagnostic technology -- now they become <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when the health applications show up.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X Prize, <unk> 10 million dollars.
We're really challenging the teams of the world to bring these technologies into a mobile device with the talk, and given that it has <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> burden is 25 and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that will not be able to call the <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force in producing a world of abundance.
I call it a billion increase.
The white lines here are the population.
We have just spent the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> that goes into global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What would you <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars in the global economy.
And more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of education with the Khan Academy -- and because of the use of impressions and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can bring us three billion members of humanity, healthy and educated and <unk>
What about some voices never before.
What if we give the underdog wherever they are, where they are, a voice to be heard and power for the first time?
What did these three billion?
And if they are <unk> we can't afford it.
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams guided by their passion with an objective of course, they can do things that could do things that could only make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's really important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played these university professors, among in each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people went around and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds that we are going to get together to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have over in front of a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may think they were <unk> but it wasn't like that.
<unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
We caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red Cross of <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, over Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that you still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they continue <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept the shift of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 degrees, the black beard <unk>
And fishing in this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was getting more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
<unk> to the five centimeters.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in the <unk> Europe, a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was actually imposing the countries that had already 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty good, he called The <unk> 4.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the South Sea Sea <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now -- yeah, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs on a little bit of <unk> remains that are fish from coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing starts.
The background is a very solid coral background, in this case, being a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
They weren't <unk> They were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what we collect fishermen every time they go to an area where they've never fish.
But there's no <unk>
We take the world, but we don't remember it.
You can pick up the starting point to start, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have things -- biodiversity, and we have things that are <unk> biodiversity, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation to use images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and <unk> forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the length of changes.
And at the end of the end, I keep <unk>
And that, in large measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when <unk> societies kill animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is a little uncommon.
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose both animal animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea will synonymous with big fish.
They become rare because they were <unk>
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they'll do it because evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect that the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like Captain such as captain would look at a lot of fish in this area can't be used or, usually they don't use the <unk> scientists, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on sources of the past.
Out of the huge role that can be a protected marine zone.
Because with marine marine areas, we really visualize the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has been run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a <unk> marine protected area and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people of the West, for example?
I think there is the arts and cinema maybe can fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago there were gray whales in <unk> Bay, 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think why people was touched by the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is to be able to do <unk> <unk> under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager for <unk> and watch YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why videos do and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, come together with a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You go over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a little percentage of it is viral is getting lots and lots of views and cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Three things: of trends, communities of participation and <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his home in Yellowstone National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> of the <unk> of the last summer.
<unk> couldn't be said to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I'm going to go through the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented to new and interesting things and they put them into a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.  You all want you to get on Friday.  Everybody wants you to get the end of a week.   You all want you to go on a Friday.  KA: Don't think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> from Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> <unk> this video seemed to come from the nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this <unk> Friday <unk>
Well, it took me <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of trends take a look at a view and they share it with a broad audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big internal joke then starts to talk about that and doing things.
And now there's 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Only in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community involvement is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an analog animation with an indigenous music.
That's all of it.
This year they saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there is a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that aroused among the Internet community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of it.
And then it was done on the air.
All of a sudden, emerged a whole community of <unk> who made this become a silly joke at something that we can all become a part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> double <unk> or Rebecca or <unk> <unk>
What might have been written might have written this situation?
In a world that you go up with two days of video a minute, just that really only only only only only only only only only is <unk> can be able to make it happen, so these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind that protest against the <unk> to <unk> in New York, I mean, I didn't get interested in too much.
Casey <unk> They <unk> me around the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you properly from the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and your humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million to see and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth everything new that we do in a creative form.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> of creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new type of media -- that we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all kind of owners from our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media features -- they're just the current media -- but we have an entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had ever supported the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
And the words, for so long friends, now they will.
They were silent.
She died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that history tried to <unk> but I did it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn -- <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when her father died, and an <unk> marriage and two small girls ...
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task for her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do this.
And after a <unk> <unk> which challenges the fiction, a boat is slid into the sea and dressed in ship vessel.
Every adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the rocks rape and death.
Like most of the adults -- my mother had a <unk> with a poison.
If we were going, first I would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories of that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but that they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the driver dying and not being able to pluck up for six hours.
But I remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I'll end up the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I tried to do was given for the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in a refugee camp.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> class suburb whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants from.
Unlike the middle class, whose existence I was in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the <unk> English fragments in the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and the extra <unk> in English and math and math and <unk> wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> who usually was <unk> it was always <unk>
Two nesting pairs for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A uniform uniform up to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> come back home.
And home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we ran over our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother's <unk>
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be wakes up until their nightmares started to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
She opened up a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition and angry and <unk> and <unk> kids caught between two worlds.
They were looking for subsidies and <unk>
And they were <unk> centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was the <unk> classic student with what I was talking about myself.
On the other, he was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, abuse of drugs and isolation.
But many of them received help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I picked the young Australian young Australian young one.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> resident <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist -- invited to talk about sites that never heard of, and in houses whose existence had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the <unk> and the happy life of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had the same age that she had when we stick up the boat.
He had never been an option.
<unk> he said, "What is you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly I did -- the more I was talking about it to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what we were living on on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> career.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a kind of unknown, new in the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear the world.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were tremendously.
There was a energy there, a optimism optimism, a weird mix of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
He would take a small group of people for the <unk> <unk> not <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he made a giant <unk> giant <unk>
<unk> all the way to <unk>
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, we opened up step.
I took the decision to move to the United States.
After one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
On the age of 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, it caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to bring the cause she itself, and a lot more <unk> caused when I won.
The cannot have been wrong.
He was in the shower in the room of a hotel in Sydney. when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around his <unk>
We tell him stories and ensure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked her <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
Don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life is built us, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have been <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might wish that for you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, you keep brave in every wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon, which is not guaranteed to nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see it, you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> <unk> singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when the Indians we wanted to travel to a car and break down the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
In that time when you <unk> the great prince of Prince Indian Indian prince had <unk> I would pull out a bow and with a <unk> the ground, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we get was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic to allow the magic of magic.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his silver <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was to my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile <unk> the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it out of it.
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> I came into this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
<unk> the text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what is that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl is excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned me very exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they light your path on what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that fascinated me was a little bit of a <unk> galaxy on a <unk>
That's why every book and every world gets into a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all fantasy book, there's always been maps but it's been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book they also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect to me is to create Indian content and a contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people were out of India know their counterparts in <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra over the millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a <unk> child story.
In a story that deals present current issues like environmental crisis.
And by talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure that we have to go outside to take the camera or iPad, and gather images of different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to get this ritual of childhood, you have to go out and, in an chapter, we would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of pictures that can then put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, now I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "We saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variations of connecting between magic, the Earth and the technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction where you come out with the iPad and the video and the video on and through augmented reality -- you see a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inner plant plants.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves leaves at the time.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and you can get it to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature are attached to technology and magic and technology will come to another one.
It <unk> the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> projects.
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at <unk> University, was <unk> to a CEO of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you find?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that we all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> would fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi. It's very simple.
It has a mood and closed <unk>
Every morning I was hooked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I was sending my information down to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is -- not at the same time that I need assistance <unk> or an urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you get up my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need an <unk> lunch.
That is the best thing that can happen, because it's peer pressure to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week, you will be available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to take away from their homes, taking their blood pressure, <unk> their physician, and share that with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back to reclaim control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about the health care because of the challenges we face as the firing of attention to attention, the demand for demand and other issues.
So techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share it with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls in <unk>
We may even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please ask you where, and when it's open, because they sometimes open up at <unk> office and they're closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks use his cell phone phone to find the nearest <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to call it globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find out working and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
And I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us join these <unk>
You might be services or <unk> <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in place.
Please go through this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here for sharing photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're pictures that they can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography was aroused with my first digital camera at 15 years.
They mixed with my passion before the drawing of it, but it was a little bit different, because when I use the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera that process ends up when the <unk> is <unk>
For me photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when they press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road <unk>
But it has a twist.
And yet, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful time -- but with the common goal of keeping the <unk> level.
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want to seem like it seems to have been captured in some way like photography.
You have to be able to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them real.
They're the details or the <unk>
Get light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how can you perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfect objects, which is something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a way you can create something that it still seems to be viewed as if you were there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's move into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those in which we don't even perceive things around us in our daily lives.
But when we combine photographs it is very important -- because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> you must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image is <unk>
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the personal thing, I think it's easier to create a place that will find it because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The coast is a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a separate of rock.
And yes, I even did a red house on the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to achieve a realistic outcome I think you need planning to do.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general direction.
This is an analysis that we were doing on the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
And what's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of others we usually see, is kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step of this is an order of magnitude, on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's something weird happens.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please, switch to the lights.
It's more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we make technology <unk> on scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve that, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any kind of time of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to give you the diagram something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you look at it for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives rise to <unk>
If the technology of shipping is going to be used as fast as the <unk> in the past morning we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't move into that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development of an ongoing growth that every few years orders of magnitude.
The question I want to pose is -- look at these <unk> curves we see that they don't sit forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We have one of two things.
Or you're going to become a typical <unk> I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, is what is that new way that they <unk> the world?
Why new is the world going.
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember, the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference that people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
It's a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because it's all going to be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to tell you about how that might be, how would that transition that <unk>
But to do that I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and I.T.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back about two and a few billion years ago when the Earth was a big rock with a lot of chemicals that would spread around them.
If you look at the way those chemicals <unk> we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think that there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, it was floating around with <unk> oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those fishing droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate from the outside of the outside and the blobs grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those blobs were not living in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random random prescription prescription of chemicals.
And every time you were <unk> they would take a distribution of <unk> of the chemicals that we <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow will become better than being better at bringing the chemical <unk> <unk> more chemicals and more chemicals and more <unk>
Often they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, very simple, very simple, but things become interesting when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this kind of meaningless evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved two and millions of years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, the same writing system.
In fact, every living being expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did only for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide from the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it took it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy for another billion years.
But then there was another big step in which things became very different, and it was that these cells started exchanging and communicating information to form that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way they avoid penicillin and they were <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that would be in a way, they were in a certain way, they were put together in a way, and a <unk>
In that way, <unk> or <unk> together, whatever if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were getting more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities came so close that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community with a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have <unk> communities in many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the one of the muscles, or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and there were more interesting levels of the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't make more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that they process information that these mobile cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the evolutionary period of time.
So an organism could, for example, learning not to eat some fruit because he knew badly and sick last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that before they had built these information processing structures that we have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit structures.
So the fact that the nervous system built up those structures of information actually accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals found the trick of communication.
So, for example, the more <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea in the head.
I'm sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a kind of kind of kind of kind of vague idea, <unk> in his heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated to make it sound, in sound sequences of sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
We now have similar periods of periods of similar periods of <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> computer <unk> the video tape -- the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've now accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you was given a billion years each.
The next few times the nervous system and the brain, it took a few hundred million years.
The next year, and so on, they took less than a million years.
And the next bit of electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess it's the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent technical advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to make it very <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers, <unk> designers -- we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that you couldn't do before, it comes far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using recently, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the time scale.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences.
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take those of you to get those that we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to just order numbers to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are most close to making numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely to be some random sequences of instructions.
But one luckily, he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that they would have done <unk>
I would take those and listen to the rest.
And now we have the best <unk> the <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will fund the properties of both programs.
So we managed to get a new generation of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
We would put some mutations into it.
And he tries again and try and get it to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that sequence absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to do this to see how they work.
It's dark programs, strangers.
But they meet the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that you get to get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
One time I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're <unk>
So we started to depend on computers to make a different different design processes of design.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
However, we don't understand the whole choices that there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
That is, you know, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time enough to allow me to give up a part of my false <unk>
Before we treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about getting <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and used them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to throw the ball into the game of game without being <unk> and that anybody who tries to tell the first base to the first base, doesn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk> <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe from the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody who 10 car <unk> beat four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the Women's League of <unk> in running more 400 strokes on a regular season.
Now I'm going to get this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what you're telling you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
This doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place and a dear self has two arteries <unk> <unk> and your family family derived from a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 <unk>
But do you know what?
She's getting better this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask them.
What do you believe that it should be the average of a heart surgeon of a heart surgeon or a nurse or a nurse -- <unk>
1,000, very good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, from a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is send them to the world, and I would include the mandate to be perfect.
I never, would never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a wise student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs was studied to a blood test.
Like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> desk in Toronto, is not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnosis of differential differential and <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis on how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as we get more and more knowledge.
And I was really fine. I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of the medical school with the impression that if you were going to take it, then would you know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought to the lady in the emergency service where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room consult a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient.
and reporting the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which is <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions, heart stops working, and instead of pump blood forward, blood goes to the lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I would tell him.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on her heart.
I gave him a <unk> of water, so that I could eliminate liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the boss of residents.
I didn't wake up the phone and did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, he would have been able to bring information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident who had constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be as successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When she sent her home to her house, I didn't pay attention to a voice on my inner that he would say, <unk> it's not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, I was so insecure that he was going to ask the nurse who would take the lady to <unk> "Do you think it's well if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay.
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so he signed up and he signed up and the ambulance next to the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I kept with my work.
At the end of the day, I got to leave the hospital and I walked to the parking lot where I was my car to go home. So I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, I did.
I went to the emergency service service.
And there is another nurse, not that I heard of the lady <unk> before, but another one. He told me three words, those three words that most medical doctors were <unk>
Other specialists too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are you? Does it remember you?
He remembers of the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and forth at the edge of death.
In an hour of an hour of having come to his house, after I gave her the high school, suffered a collapse and her family called the <unk> the ambulance brought the emergency room with a 50 millimeters of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a severe severe.
I was just <unk> and it was blue.
The emergency staff would give you all their resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care and hoped against all the hope that they would meet.
And in the age of two or three days was clear that I never will.
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together together.
And in eight or nine days, they went to what was going on.
And by the ninth day, she left her going. The lady was <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks -- I was concerned about it and experienced for the first time I was <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame is because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would love the stuff and I made sure that I didn't love me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> why made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose <unk>
Soon that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, <unk> opened the sky and finally came out, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were going to take the efforts to be perfect for not to make more mistakes, I would make those voices away.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, I was an assistant, in the emergency department in a community in the north of Toronto, and I got a 14-year-old man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He was offered penicillin and he sent him home.
But while he ran to the door he was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard shift, my chief asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I gave the three words: <unk> remember you?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
He came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not because of the throat, but on the upper side, it can cause the close of those tracks.
He was fortunately, not dead.
It was <unk> antibiotics by <unk> and they recovered in the same few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it was a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
It turned out an X-ray of it, but it was normal. A colleague who was checking out the patient <unk> some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, and called the surgeon's surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague who would take it.
I checked it down and to notice some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both were operated and recovered well.
But every single case, I love <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't get my eyes and talk about my errors, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe he would have a hard time in looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system in which there are two <unk> who make mistakes and those who do not sleep and the ones that I know; those who have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years of about being <unk> and medical journalism, I've made a personal study of medical litigation and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote to the Hebrew Toronto to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system in which mistakes happen every day, where one in 10 drugs are happening in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system in which infection infections are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 Canadian by medical errors in them.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there's things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going down every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
Now sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain and <unk> <unk> eyes, and with breath and <unk> and suddenly my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do the same way.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't take their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us, and we eliminate all the professional professionals to error, well, we won't get anybody.
And with regard to people who don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art.
And their students would be <unk> and she will slow down your head and <unk> saliva and start telling your stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical culture culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor is human, they know human, accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They would take their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> errors in other people not with intention of <unk> but a loving way for all of them to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes rather than then.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, I would make errors mistakes.
And so I feel a lot but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what it is, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day off.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick a half a half a half a day.
It's not a long ago in a research on a research week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks <unk> for these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs.
Naturally, every job there were lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent required for an hour or more than time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
So how do they include the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to pick up the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when I ask a question, if your answer is positive -- please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear the problem of the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
As a graduate student at the University of Stanford, I wrote this very, very <unk> supermarket at least at the time that was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a park in <unk>
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 water water, and this was when we got water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why never bought nothing?
This is a shelf on the oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones who were in the box of <unk> trees.
I was once I decided to go to the manager and I asked her, "You know, well this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the one.
That's a pathway.
They had different kinds of classes.
<unk> a post to <unk> right to the entrance to the store.
We put out there with six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we look at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop stopping <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60 than when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
When I stopped when there was only three percent of three percent got to buy <unk>
What you stood in when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found 24.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably don't buy less is good for conserving the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices are affecting us at <unk> decisions.
We decided to do not to decide, even though this doesn't get us.
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for retirement of about a million Americans, from between about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in to see if the number of <unk> money plans for retirement savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program, to people save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 options.
And we found that the bigger the number of funding funds there were less participation.
So if we look at extreme ends, we see that in plans that offer two funds, the death rate was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in plans for the plans for about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the older it was the number of more choices, more people will be used to avoid actions or hedge funds.
In terms of more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts of market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we want to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, even though this is still against the interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, in the health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it better.
The main reason is that we can look at that huge variety of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choice of that stunning <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have to, in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in your businesses.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which has never been more.
People always care about when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But in fact, what we're seeing is more and more that if you decide to cut, get rid of <unk> options, there will be an increase in sales, we'll have a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate <unk> eliminated the products for a waste of cats to waste that the less <unk> the <unk> was increased by <unk> by two major sales and lower sales and lower sales.
You know that today's coffee supermarket.
In a Walmart store there are about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the finance world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the best choices is this <unk> David <unk> program.
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a safety of life.
The people really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all <unk> options.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there is between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience with a holiday holiday with all paid for the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to get it, and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take <unk>
<unk>
Isn't it more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew that there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really had to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first turn, than in the second, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it become more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences should be feeling very specific in a very particular way.
Why is people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when it uses debit or debit cards than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out that making it be <unk> can be a very positive tool for people to make more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> staff who were working in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were getting into a <unk> plan.
And that meeting that <unk> exactly how it was <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that we would give the staff to think of the positive things that he would think of in his lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hall of magazine.
What we saw was that there was in supermarket <unk> along the <unk> display exhibition can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But, you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the right is <unk> But you know what?
This framework is completely useless.
The categories must tell you something to <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge lists of fundraising.
Now, I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think, if you just do it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good <unk> a car buying a car.
This is a car German manufacturer that allows <unk> to <unk>
You have to make a thousand decisions and make a car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices for each other.
I get outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions make place.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just a few examples, four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to get a few more choice, four <unk> in 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
So what are you so involved in.
If you get <unk> whenever the default button is that you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones who are going from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to a lot, they keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to disrupt the order where information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although we pick the box of change not to say anything about the preferences of <unk> within, in every ways we are prepared to choose.
So we're excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternative <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories in less categories of <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for the people who serve.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful by <unk>
And the more we're being careful in our choices better we can practice <unk> art.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in East Germany -- if you had a typewriter I had to write to the government.
I had to record a piece of text that was written with the machine.
And so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written written written by the wrong message, you could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
And in the West we don't think that someone could do this, so much that this would make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and prints a page, that page will end up having a little printed yellow points on every page that you follow a pattern that makes them one and your printer.
That's happening to us today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world we can put up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, huge numbers.
There are actually a lot of people on the online line, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media through banking <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a computer <unk>
The secret in America two months ago -- <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> He's <unk> your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> which of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be worse in worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them to find them motivate laughter.
groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a leading role in the attacks online.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who made it to protest and the last group are the national national governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authoritative authority from the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
It was <unk> the last fall fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site and brought a <unk>
And last week I asked myself in a meeting with government representatives of government and asked one of the leaders if they <unk> <unk> death of people to cause the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do you make the <unk>
Well, you need to have if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we would take a foreign authority authority.
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt <unk> the headquarters for the secret secret police headquarters in 2011, 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept a large scale of the communication of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the U.S. government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools for governments to do that to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you were suspicious in a good criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
The Internet connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like this the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why is it <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's actually playing privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If you could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to spend today, will be forever.
<unk> in any future government, in a management we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have been worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the South Park of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi did not have fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of park.
And, predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found him very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
People were dying that they protect our community and won, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in Yellowstone National Park.
A child in my community, at six to nine years is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing to happen to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions would be afraid.
But I realized that actually this didn't really be <unk> because even I could even help lions see the pen <unk>
I don't love <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back, and they said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed in animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which to turn up and turn the lights.
And this is a little <unk> from a <unk> <unk>
It took everything.
As you can see, the solar cell is the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity into the little <unk> box. I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights off.
As you can see, the <unk> get out there, because that's where lions.
And this is what lions see when they come at night.
<unk> lights and <unk> to the lions for you to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never became a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood in the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and I asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them. You can see the bottom -- these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now because of all Kenya, to frightening other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also being used for <unk> elephants in farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk>
Even I took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows in the <unk> <unk> cows of my father, and I used to see planes and told me that someday would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions with no conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you get a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next to your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electric fence -- CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you invented electric power -- but I want to do my own.
CA: You know, you put it back once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot, Richard <unk> you're something big.
We're going to do it in every step that you get to my own.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Not <unk> anything."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except that the Americas, South Japan are the enemies.
Although I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed a sudden.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never starving.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister from my sister.
That said, "When I read this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks before.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in her arms looking at his own mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine hit North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more <unk> the energy <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except for the lights in the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at the night compared to the countries in the following side.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to grow <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes, it would see bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that in the course of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take to be 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But I suddenly learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of around North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was made, when I was arrested for Chinese police, and I was arrested at the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked a lot of questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum in <unk>
But many of them can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although the <unk> had were eventually released after a major international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, endless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape a lot of other North Koreans haven't had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of the world can be deployed in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to put on the South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call my pride in mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the teacher exam <unk>
And just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had some money sent to my family, and as blame my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location removed in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started plan how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in some way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey on <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He was asking for everybody, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way down to the <unk> frontier.
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going and came out between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would love to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary -- I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I would put it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why are I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to <unk> when I was more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea, and I joined us.
But the freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the English language, <unk> and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us keep in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that are helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South.
This is <unk> grocery stores, fast food, fast food, <unk>
So the planners of the city came together and thought, we're going to change the South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles as well as if this would be <unk> what's actually wrong with the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, living in a food desert, and L.A., the heart Center -- home of food places to take and eat in the car.
<unk> is that places of food to carry more people killed than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles Central Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
And I was glad to see that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of home see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> wheelchair and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers.
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and the solution.
I also got tired of how to drive 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that has not pesticide to.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters by 45 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it up.
I said, "Well, I can do the thing that comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this is how I decided to keep it up.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we get together and we started planting our food forest -- trees -- you know, nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of paid money <unk> made by the gardeners of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, it was beautiful.
And then somebody else is <unk>
The city was on top of the city and <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A warrant by plant food on a piece of land that nobody else was <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's get it."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. was written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> was a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> I even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America's more <unk>
It's <unk> miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> millions of tomato plants.
Why on Earth does it not look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a thousand, 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South America.
I grew up there, <unk> my children there.
And I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The gardening is my <unk> I culture my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You can see how it affects kids.
<unk> is the <unk> act and thought that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, which came up with a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and were in my backyard, and they were looking very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people that I was so close to me, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes that people will steal your <unk>
And I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid you're going to go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to get it, but at the same time, I want you to go through her <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in a shelter in the middle of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared their stories about how this had affected us and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, they work and they work every single volunteer plan.
If kids grow up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you're not taught how the food affects your mind and the body, they eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing that you're stuck. I see these color boys that are on this path designed for them, which is not taking them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are taking care of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe we have the next George Washington D.C.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all one block from gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to bring containers and turn them into a healthy <unk>
I don't care about me.
I'm not talking about free things, because it is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What I talk to talk about is to put people out of the street, pull the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and honor of growing their own food by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take their <unk>
That is the weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I'm not calling me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very good road at all.
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good thing to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water on asphalt that we will see.
And especially if you're wired on your bicycle and these cars go on, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, you would want a <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so all the rainwater will flow into the sides and you have a road that is easy to drive, and it doesn't get water to it.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can see it.
What is <unk> you see that on this road hit the surface stones on the surface.
First of a stone, then several more and more, and more, and so on, and you can break this --  But you can hurt your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see what damage appears in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will become <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you take the <unk> as we saw it here.
So to solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material off, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use wool wool from that to clean up, and we can cut out the wool wool in tiny, small bits and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of wool wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is you heat steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and rocks go back to the surface.
I used an oven, because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here to the stage.
<unk> is a similar system.
I put the show I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tried lots of samples there, and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to get them out.
So we did a little bit of a road, 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> in which we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We did aging for samples, we put a lot of payload on them, and the ear then with our machine <unk> and we put them back into it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers incorporating these fibers, using the energy in order to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, and you can even double the lives of the surface.
And now, of course, they have curiosity about whether this worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, it has to be cool first before I can show you how it acts it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was hearing News on his little gray radio.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual in those days, because the news is usually <unk>
<unk> <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were packed with Afghanistan and they made girls illegal to go to school.
For the next five years, I grew up as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route so that no one could be suspicious where they were <unk>
We had to hide books on market bags to look like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all know that we would define our life -- the teacher, students and our parents.
And once in a while, the school suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you did it?
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters was <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> where his daughter, my mother, my mother went to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my mother raised became a teacher.
This is her.
It took two years ago, only to convert our home to school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his entire family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive their daughters, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate her children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father would say, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can try it to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your blood to pay for your education, we will.
So you still want not to <unk>
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have more than high school, and if my family wouldn't have been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school from <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just get away from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I wear it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador to educate a global campaign to educate the women.
It's because of what <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is I see students in my school with the strong desire to tap into the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> by them, despite them, even in front of a opposition opposition in them.
As <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than one month, he and her daughter went from the way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to his house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he was following his daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> now if he said, "but I wouldn't harm the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> ideas."
What I realized from Afghanistan, and this is something that is most often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the Afghanistan, we need support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school are told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that the Americans see the fragility of changes.
It would argue that these changes didn't last long, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that the <unk> I see a future future and a society change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls from <unk> I would love it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
never, I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But never go back to a revolutionary <unk>
They have spent almost two years since the Copernican revolution was inspired by the surge of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution as the <unk>
A forces with many other citizens were born inside and outside of the country to call a <unk> day and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men were in the edge, <unk> each of the regime, they are carrying freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a courage to deal with the brutal dictatorship <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal War and some loss of loss of about 50 thousand dead people, we managed to liberate our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, with a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a inclusive and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation society.
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
And after a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about business development and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we started to start the <unk> of women -- <unk> <unk> of the <unk> a movement of women, very supportive orientation to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of women and the right of our right to work in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is increasingly <unk> of selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was augmented and successful.
Women won an <unk> of the National Congress in the first choices in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, they were <unk> every day in news of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and ancient mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of murder of the murder of the American ambassador, and the heart attack.
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military officer.
And every day, each day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and his statistically human rights violations and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up of a revolutionary mindset, it became more and away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The passion <unk> and the revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here at all to meet us with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, chose evil, we made the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize right.
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and safety to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men like women?
Maybe what was missing were not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the election -- that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation of women's most than need <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call a few days of anger.
We need to start acting like agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not just <unk> but it's also putting it in <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration instead of competition rather than competition rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> in the war, desperately needs to be in order to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> which spans all the humanity of the men who are men and women, who all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus cover completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine amount of compassion -- all the existence of existence.
This is what you say, "My <unk> covers all the things."
So you say, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That we are all given to them, the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a pessimistic question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody is doing well, why she's left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who would tell him.
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, not an expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I had about <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> green <unk> and had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I create my alma alma mater, I would join the head with a <unk> loaded with bullets from <unk> <unk>
The man who loved one person in this world, put a gun in my head and try and get it more than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA on <unk> from the Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been about 20 years married to my second husband and three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the races, all of the religions, all of the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse -- or <unk> or <unk> or said in the families, the last place where we would want to or would we expect to find <unk> reason why, domestic abuse, is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would stay with a man who hits him, and I actually was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of ages women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands on <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, its warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he had just had a <unk> university from the <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was most impressed by that first meeting was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
He had a few big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it mostly at the beginning of the beginning, in a <unk>
We started out and loved everything from <unk> who was so ready, that I had gone to Harvard, I put a passion in helping girls teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know it all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer, as a woman, like nobody had ever done it.
And it was why I went through that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go from New York and let my job work on my dreams, but I thought I had to do for your partner for your partner, so I was able to quit my work and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was moving from head into a physical trap. financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And this is where they come into the scene at this point.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you were supposed to be able to feel so safe was bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
The other one kept it underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed these guns to cause a trauma that lived small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I had never lifted my hand, my life was really serious about danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend suit of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we lived happily forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
He had just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
I had been a isolated accident, and I had never been damage.
I spent two times more on our <unk>
And the first time I was driving down to a secret beach and <unk> me, and he gave me so strong in the head that I would spend several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our head of honey, he was <unk> by the traffic of honey, and I threw a Big Mac <unk> to the face.
<unk> followed <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or offline at some time in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had a very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I tell me?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was picking up with me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man -- and it was the only person in the world who could help us to cope with <unk>
The other question that everybody does is: Why don't you just get <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people, because we, the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has finally put to the relationship, after <unk> because then <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marriage, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family family system to protect the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, because of one last slide, he will wake my denial.
I realized the man who I loved so much, would have killed me if there was so allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world: I told the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family and family and I am here today because all of you will get stuck here.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as headlines -- women are providing <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> <unk> as if the <unk> victims intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also assumed that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them, and that they would save their lives lives joyful lives and happy and mothers, completely free lives, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I became married with a cute man, and I have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I won't go back to have ever more, was a <unk> <unk> pointing to my head in somebody who says I want.
Right now, as you are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which was <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or they were <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, her sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I'm still doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
abuse thrives only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They set up the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their friends, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future future.
It will make the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our families and our families on the oasis of secure and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there's a awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like this.  Luckily, I've brought some clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get it right now, but figure out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
So these guys are very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through the head, because it is when you're going to make a lot of me, so I don't do anything while I cover your head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much like this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed what I thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I would hold my back and get the hair out of the child.
Of course, except for surgery or a <unk> <unk> like the one I did two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our lives, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my labor sector, that's being an sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that is my <unk> <unk> that I have known to use to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there are some lovers of fashion that <unk> Stop. There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, we would find them out of how much models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York talked about all and every single models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> is to say, less than four percent, not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when you grow up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know.
But then, what I would really tell you about every one of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or an <unk> surgeon ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this spectacular list still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> chief of American magazine or the next executive director, or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike the <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get your studies, and you have a bunch of jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to do, that you want to be president of the United States, but you want to be <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but your scores <unk> Model clothes for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always ask me is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was passionate about, and I was also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering a personal field, but it was a child.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my soccer team and in the magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> from a group of professionals, <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: "We do things for for free?
I have too many inches of <unk> and I never use, except the couple previous pair -- but the privilege I get is the ones I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to wear money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light in red and, of course, we were feeling -- and I was sorry, agent to be able to continue <unk>
<unk> of these privileges not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for how it doesn't matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the <unk> teenagers who stood up and <unk> 86 percent were black and Latino people, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino kids in New York, so for them, is not a question of <unk>
But how many times do I think about it, and <unk>
When I looked at this talk, I found out that the 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can see it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and we also be able to work with creative people, smart and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask, if you ever ask, with a little thinner and the brightest hair and your hair would be happier?
They only have to meet with a bunch of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the brightest hair and the more at fashion -- but probably are the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of race and gender and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to retain in this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception of the image of the image of the success and failure.
Thank you.
The photography has been my passion since I was older enough to attach a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go to the <unk>
There were no directors or no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimal <unk> in lighting.
In fact, most of them took them at random.
My story begins when I was in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and five.
He just happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday I was approaching my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you back to New York City on a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that were going to come up with the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown unknown is so universal.
No one has ever denied and fortunately, no one has ever heard of the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five-year-old was able to understand.
These pictures are much more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on a week, and to make us think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in every other way.
Because, though we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my <unk> new <unk> and I can see life through her eyes and how it interacts and interacts with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, on one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it was made in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the toy shop that would show you small in earlier visits
And it described to me what there was sense to the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart will be able to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of being actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get out of a lot of the familiar pictures.
I'm always going to get out the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you don't want to go back to somebody and asked, take it out a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are found in the most popular <unk>
First of all, why have they so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter as well as <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that I associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> are not helping prevent disease <unk>
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> they have better presence.   There are two kinds of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mainly at <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of the West Bank, where we have 16 species from these 16, 11 to a high risk of extinction.
So why <unk> are important, first of all, provide ecological ecological services.
They are our <unk> of natural waste.
<unk> the cadavers up to bone.
They help kill all the bacteria they help absorb anthrax that not to be caused by them would stretch and caused huge losses from livestock and disease into other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have tremendous important importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between Alto, and below Egypt.
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and he risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of 10 shrunken heads.
In <unk> culture, a few really important <unk> to open sky -- in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to protect them, so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the extreme end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there is conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities, use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In the South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the endangered list of extinction, -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey out of livestock consumption which has been treated with a drug that has been treated like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use veterinarian in India and have taken a stance.
Since there has been a <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge time pump for <unk> <unk> number of cases of anger has increased India enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds. They do it to the birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and to the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focusing on a locally consumer problem, it's not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> level.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that are <unk>
How can you help? it can become assets, making noise. Can you write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures. They would have their time to spread the word <unk> the word.
When out of this room, you would tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw it fly without effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young <unk> but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We were talking to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of everything that we would think about it, <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people about Zambia to grow food.
So we got with <unk> <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley, that descends down to the <unk> River, and we teach local tomatoes and Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were all at all interested in doing that, so they were giving them to work to come to work, and sometimes they were <unk>  We were amazed that local in such fertile valley, they had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a real tomato to this size. In Zambia, of this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is.
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> came from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> "You're never <unk>
I thought that only we were Italians making mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans, what Americans were doing -- what the French did, what the French did and then see what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we gave to <unk> people from Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read their book.
<unk> part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> Mormon missionaries and treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words came from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
And yet, they mean two different things.
<unk> I'm trying to do any of a different culture as if I were my children, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture of culture as if I were my <unk>
That's why white people in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, "I'm small <unk> written by <unk> who said about developing economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to have 27 years to answer people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you have never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does it do? You <unk>
It would never get a community with an idea, and you sit with people from the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We sat down in a coffee bar. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give a sense of someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what are you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years back, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, for once, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never had, and they will never have a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family physician from the company, the family doctor of business who sets up with you in your house, at the coffee table, and that helps him find the resources to transform her passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this extra garbage that we get to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects in march, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so I got <unk>   So the government says, <unk> <unk>   We have done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> One of the greatest business academic research in history, passed away to '96,
Peter <unk> was a professor in philosophy before you get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
Planning is the kiss of death from the spirit of business.
So now we are <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most enjoyable people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you.
You have to offer you to <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then you will come out in the mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you talk about is more this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the spirit entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial industrial revolution, <unk> fossils -- and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution. The <unk> <unk>
The government? government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a wonderful story that was in a futuristic magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> a bunch of people gathered this group of people -- and they were talking about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't be within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we would spend the life of New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years in 1900, in 1900, in the United States were <unk> generic commercial companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you to <unk>
Otherwise they will not come to talk with you.
Then you have to give you an absolute <unk> dedicated service.
And then then you have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smaller company, the larger company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell -- you have to be fantastic, you have to have to have a fantastic marketing -- and you have to have a great financial management challenge.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, sell and find money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the 100 quarters of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all new companies -- Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one one person was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't only when he started.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in bars with the coffee environment in bars alongside you, what somebody did for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who will ask you, what needs it?
What can you? Can you do that?
Well, you can hear it. Can you look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." It was looking for <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
People who are around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, that's why I don't swap a lot of knowledge even though of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How can we share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which gives <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always comes to accommodate music.  There is a parade in New York City --  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most beautiful abandoned properties of the U.S.
I live close to this house and I thought how I could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
Your death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And this made me a deep gratitude for the time and lived on.
It gave the clarity of the significant life of my current life.
But I would try to keep this look at my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be going to catch on the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant <unk> on a giant board and he painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before he died.
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to die at <unk>  "Before I die I want to die in the line of change in <unk>
"Before you die I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die from dying to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
"Before you die I want to get it again more and longer."
"Before you die I want to go to the rescue of <unk>
"Before it die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and dreams and hopes for people and hope for people to laugh at <unk> and they gave me solace in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and new ways -- it's about giving the reflection of the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what's most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the heart center, we made a kit and now they've been made up in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions in increasing, it's more important than ever, to find out the ways to preserve the perspective and remembering that life is short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that to prepare for death is one of those things that are giving us more power.
If you think about death -- we would think of our life.
Our shared spaces can actually reflect better than individuals and as community and more means to share hope, fears and fears and stories, people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
Not speaking, but it gives you joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
You share it. It happens what will happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and look at this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to name the words that I couldn't even think of, I remember one thing: the little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year in which I came out every of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we had when I was four years old, would be pee on my arm during the first episode of <unk> and Scott's birthday <unk>
You don't find that cool?
But most people don't.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the overall notion of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though you wouldn't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> autistic and remarkable.
Now, for those of those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social media, learning and sometimes to the physical skills.
In each individual stands in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, it will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the development disorders that you increase in the world, there is no cause no cure <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
I lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in line around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eat whatever it was <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> frustration and <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature, a child who sees the world without <unk> a human being that there was never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments when I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and love, and I realize that they're things I wouldn't want to change by normality.
<unk> passes through the beauty that give us the difference and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some are wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in their inner and, honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time that we try to be like others.
Please don't say I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a communications teacher who gave me a kind of communication to students from engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> <unk> of these students with his great minds, their great books and his big unknown <unk>
But when those conversations were, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
And so I sat down when I had those conversations with the students. I was surprised by ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a huge communication.
We need to desperately have a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges -- from energy to health care and health care to each other, and if we don't know what we don't understand about this, the job is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as the scientists not have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please go ahead with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that we can see your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for me, and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
You don't just tell us that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care about <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate its science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they are ways to hook and engage with their content.
And by presenting his job, forget the signs of <unk>
You have asked why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> the bullets are going to be killed, and they have their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's being supported by the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then to provide graphs that would correspond to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it was <unk>
I think these are just some key that you can help others open the door, and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English words is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor in the 19th century that was defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks for a public charge without any matter -- and that when he wins, you get it through the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means to <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to mention the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They put in on the Torre London Tower and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end had such popular support in London that won.
And just a few years later we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to actually show you how words and policy interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How would you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There were all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> State <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tested <unk>
And they didn't even have the idea that you could be elected King for a given <unk>
And there could be <unk>
All of the world got tired and <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and I always wore it with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against the <unk>
<unk> House didn't want Washington to become power.
They didn't want to call it King if he would give him or his mailing ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> title and more unfortunate title than you came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. There was no longer before, but it only meant <unk> that I would take a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I had no more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and it was really a trivial title.
And that's why the Senate is <unk>
They said, "Well ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign a treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will do it seriously.
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate was not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the President.
President Barack Obama has kind of standing there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> it might be waiting for <unk> years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this -- I want to tell you that the American President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have over 5,000 warheads to disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of autonomous aerial vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has accessible to the title of <unk>
So the end won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness at the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has <unk> <unk> <unk> etc.
So, at the end the Senate won and the <unk> House because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now they're President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do with you about.
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but actually changing the very much more words than what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under the land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body <unk> in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but mostly that cacophony of male <unk> and rocks <unk> with primitive.
Like others, I've been wearing a cheap <unk> of <unk> light strapped to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> the branches that the walls of that hole that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
I took my hand up, and I suddenly remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost control and dropped countless meters in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep at that hole, and that hole doesn't pay any reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they may never do it because they are prey of slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there was a <unk> of <unk> the <unk> an NGO who's dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not about it grade.
When we ended up talking to me, I was really curious about ignoring this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
It was made up my stomach <unk> and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered them my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world in the world.
It's twice as much of the number of Africans displaced throughout the tries of slaves to <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer farmer was about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars of people today.
And yet, today you can harvest, entire families for generations by <unk> debt, <unk>
Surprisingly, slavery generates profits from over 80 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with good promise of good education and work to find out that they are forced to work without pay, under violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods, goods of slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
The slavery exists in most of the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick <unk>
This kind of weird show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in an temperature of 54 degrees C, men, children, in fact, entire families were held in a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their head, until 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> they work silent, doing this task and again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no breaks to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made you pee very <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera turned down too hot to touch and let it work.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for me, and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry and the <unk> which was on my side and he was very quickly grabbed me, and he said, <unk> not <unk> Don't do it here."
And it explained to me so clearly that emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
It couldn't give you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not a citizen of that country.
You could put them in a situation worse than they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for his release and trusted and he trusted it.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas I found children carrying stones over miles per mile down to trucks they were waiting at the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who put the load and the children would put them into their heads with straps -- made of <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know who are slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers took their freedom, the <unk> had had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, I told me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I became <unk> women who had previously been sexually <unk>
It took me on the stairs <unk> that gave this basement basement <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more like a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for force force.
They have small rooms and private rooms where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of just seven years -- are forced to <unk> customers and encourage customers to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I barely could imagine what it should be caught in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where he <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no windows enough to be <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we play a very difficult topic to point out that slavery, even human trafficking, is all around us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year like sex slaves.
This is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait.
The black hands of black are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these large barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me the stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
You still hope, yet to be able to go out of this house someday and go somewhere where we really pay us our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the highest artificial lake in the world.
When we came there, I went through a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers -- some young children, some young kids, makes sense of it.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families who were <unk> <unk> and forced to work working on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to come up with it was a topic that her little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees in the Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, they often catch networks and children, and with fear, they spread the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
Because of fear of his love isn't going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it tries to the youngest slaves in his command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from one another.
<unk> in the cold winter night.
And it fits that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners in Ghana with partners in <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> and he <unk> and <unk> our car and played the window.
It asked us to take it on a land path to the forest.
At the end of the way, we would get away from the car, and he asked the driver to come up quickly.
And then pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started down, we took the <unk> that we roll on the road, and after walking around an hour found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as they go to my head as they were going to go into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in a clear, and we had in front of a black holes that I could fit into a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children tied their back, and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in water with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in a part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at her eyes tired, <unk> because a lot had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have up to 90 meters and these people have taken heavy stone bags that then they'll be transported to another area where they were able to get the rock to be able to extract the gold.
First of view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer, the margin is going to be able to work on other less fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely to be able to end up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died he took him to work with him in mines.
They die his uncle, you inherit the debt of the uncle to what force to be slave in mines.
When I met him, she had worked on mines 14 and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said that I should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and yet to that, it's forced to work on night and day on that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, from the face to a remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to have testimony from them and that we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves each other as human beings, then it makes it very difficult to be <unk> like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect to their lives.
There is no day that happens to happen that I don't think about these so many beautiful, <unk> people that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in those who see them, and I hope that force will turn up a fire and I hope that force will turn into a fire and that fire made light into the slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make <unk> math and there's a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like management consultants.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk> -- and we're going to see later on.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably some <unk> <unk> that you can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease -- destroy this extraordinary ability as well as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a virtuous dancer dance.
In the last few years has been made a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is a cure that will be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's so frustrating that for Parkinson's disease and other disorders of the movement has no biological <unk> That's why they don't serve the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test of ourselves?
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinic <unk>
So what I want to do is that I want to <unk> as a very conventional way to try, you see, in some sense at least we are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds like speak. We can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of the genes -- the <unk>
And as a cousin requires a pretty extraordinary training.
Let's think about the time it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal vocal cords as <unk> and so the Parkinson's will affect the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom plot you can see a irregular shake example of vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
I shake a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these examinations based on the voice with the clinical clinical trials, they are <unk> Well, they're both not <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
Both are <unk> OK, but also <unk> exams are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're minimum cost, and we all know what happens to happen.
When something is given a cost that <unk> it appears at massive scale.
These are some incredible lists to address.
We can reduce the hard difficulties in the patients.
It would not take to go to the clinic for routine.
<unk> monitoring we could get goals.
We could make a mass <unk> for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a big scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I'm going to give you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's disease.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record lots of voices around the world to gather enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, you can call it under price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
So thank you.  Tom Rielly: So I will take all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease. TR: Yeah.
<unk> You can see, some people may not be <unk> they may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data attached in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion for the real markers of the disease.
TR: You have an precision <unk> at this moment?
So much more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job, and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone network, too, what we built the project right now is 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March from March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We <unk> in the darkness, in rooms without windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models, even more perfect skin we do as impossible as possible, and we get to focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience, and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
Shortly after later, an organization where I was <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't sit at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 in May I traveled to <unk>
It's a small fishermen of fishermen located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The level of water has reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles land.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
We have simulated rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and leave the lists to be <unk> and <unk>
Three tons of fish and tons of fish died, <unk> <unk> of the local ones.
We love us, and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of photos and cameras and <unk>
Everybody did the same.
And they took them to different places from villages around the villages around them.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save her lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started helping in a <unk> center of the people.
giant helped clean the toilets, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the <unk> center -- the photos.
And I had the honor of them and I had the honor of that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't even beyond myself as my horizons.
By looking at the photos, I found some that had more than a hundred years more than a hundred years, I couldn't help but think of how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook, I contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we needed to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her itself, and that would be as tragic as having the picture of the picture.
Over the time of time, they came to be kind of more photos, and they needed more <unk> so I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 other countries volunteered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people who were <unk> from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village north of <unk>
Once on the week we use our scanner in the temporary <unk> libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we were born in <unk> is a different story depended on of course <unk> of the photos.
It could take quite an hour. It could take a few weeks.
It could take a few months.
This <unk> had to draw virtually by hand using a guide <unk> the areas whose color and detail was not <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures that were held in seawater, covered with bacteria, and even oil over the time with the time of the time I continue to <unk> which was a big part of the project.
We couldn't afford it to less than were clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky enough with <unk>
We count on a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the pictures already <unk>
As once he said -- the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her same but stopped to realize that it was even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and their own face would not have been <unk> we were able to put the images into a single picture and put the whole picture.
When he collected their pictures shared some of his history with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the photos on a fire station between the rubble far away from where they used to be their house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the job of closing the barriers to the wave.
He had to go into the water while the <unk> <unk>
His young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in schools in different areas.
One of them stuck in the water.
He took a week to find his entire family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day he gave him his pictures his little son was getting 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could do, something that he could go back to look, something that could remember from the past one day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan had joined up there -- hundreds of them were helped us clean hand over <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the great majority went back to the hands of their owners <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to bring back to 90 families hundreds of entirely preventable photos and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and teams -- most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, someone loved.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take away with, but the first thing that you would try to look for.
This was the project about restore small pieces of humanity, to bring back to somebody who is connected to the past.
When a picture like this gets somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger, to bring something, using your talents to something that are not perfect models of perfect skin.
I would just like to read this email. I would like to read this electronic email -- I went back to Cindy the day I went back from Japan after six months.
While I was <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a picture with women in different ages from Grandma to the small child, gathering around a baby, <unk> me, because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my daughter <unk> hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, all of our basic needs are <unk> right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us awe and curious about this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in a single millionth of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can make videos in a slow motion of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without using X-rays, and <unk> really the idea of camera.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it into a <unk> second, you know, in a number of <unk> you can create a <unk> pack.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet of a common bullet than a common bullet of it.
If we take that bullet and this <unk> piece of photons and you get it into this bottle, how do you disperse those photons inside this <unk>
What's the aspect of the light in <unk>
Now, this whole --  -- remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to take this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a piece of photons and it starts <unk> and inside it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes on to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally get to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the <unk> some of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that some insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common and regular bullet and make it go the same distance and you see it slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take you to see that film?
One day? In fact, a week?
It would be a very boring film -- a slow <unk> in motion.
And what about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves coming out of the table and the tomato wall and the bottom wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature looks like a picture, and I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition here.
But if you look at one more time, you realize that, as the light gets away from the tomato -- it's still bright. They don't get away.
Why? Because the real tomato is <unk> and the light bounce inside and it goes back after several <unk> a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell -- you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera at month?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture at <unk> it comes up very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the <unk> exposure -- so you just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over and over again with a very tight <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data on crude and <unk> <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future future would allow him to see behind the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw something out of light on the door, you'd go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could get those multiple light points of light.
It's not science fiction. We've already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a dummy and <unk> light at the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our <unk> has unique capabilities.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to hidden objects, but we don't know what extent it corresponds to what a distance.
When you project a laser and you can record a picture, which you see on the screen, it doesn't really make sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, we would encourage them, and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can you see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this in the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going on on the curve.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light as reflected by open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and blood and this is pretty hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization <unk> to solve the problems of thinking in health care for the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he himself was a scientist, he became the science of art, an art of photographs of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect is not just for scientific visualization, but we can see them.
So creating a new form of computer photography with slow motion and color code.
So let's look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just about a second.
But here is also a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are going from us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
So it turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects. So Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which events occur in the world sometimes is thrown into the camera.
<unk> the corresponding of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you freedom
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and you can get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to go for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. You can imagine if all these people gathering that they <unk> in search of a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who here are a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how my life changed.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
databases.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission on the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says every European company European every single U.S. <unk> every single U.S. <unk> has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who's sent to <unk>
And if we use the cellphone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and to two years, in his phone company or his Internet <unk>
And all over Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, they said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be saved 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police for East Europe.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> that at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which is for me, all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to the question, and I didn't get a particular answer, it was all blah, <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to put a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we'll give you this information.
At the end of the end, he <unk>
And they would send me the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court ruled the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
When I first saw them, and I said, well, it's an enormous file, OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
Was it a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the data retention means.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open London City did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and go out, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call it on the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives you a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we're talking a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls the other, and the other one, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate to each other to what time they call each other to what time they want to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who would send you an email from email who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, had a mobile phone in the pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known as the leaders, this had never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And, as a result, not every single <unk> <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and business agencies want to store as much information from us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the chance to follow our lives and they want to get it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When I come home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not just in fashion.
When you go home, you get your representative to your representative because the companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that take them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello guys, what's going on?
It's not enough.
Hello guys, what's going on?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I put my mom six times in six different directions, I would get to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why they <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mix of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> and it can't be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins brothers, but they are.
It's only happening by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of us to do that one.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be a disabled.
Come for a walk.
<unk> <unk> are in the shopping center, you're driving in circles and so what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I mean, I have a 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a golden medal.
I am <unk> Muslim woman, disabled disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Yellowstone <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
Many people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> dance <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to the public school, my parents went to the school system, and I was aware that I was also outside, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note -- all of my mother's <unk>
My father taught me how to walk the five years to put my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me to get it to you.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion that has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, only six Arab in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are now 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think no one was realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a campaign.
The people I grew up with had no trouble with my faith.
But it seemed to be a lot like a lot to die of hunger during the <unk>
I would tell you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating three and eating the dawn of dawn on sunset is really easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> He's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to pass on summer holidays on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we were not going to Palestine all the <unk> we would get stuck in <unk>
In summer summer when I was often trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> and I was drinking milk from <unk> on the back of my back, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the cure <unk> was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before he was doing yoga was a comedian of <unk> that he couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it on the head.
My parents who had this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college, I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, which is the State of Arizona, which was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater.
I all shook me.
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my classes, and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> At the end will have a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of it. At the end of it. At the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying the theater department, crying like someone had killed my cat, asking me why and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't do the stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the one that literally had been born and gave it to an actor without cerebral <unk>
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors with no disabled <unk>
When I graduated home, I went home, and my first tour tour, it was kind of extra in a <unk>
My dream was made true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> and it didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> principals not necessarily <unk> actors, not just with disabilities.
Just join perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I became <unk>
In my first tour, it took comics famous from New York to New Jersey, and I never forget the face of the first comedian that led to the time he was at high speed from the New Jersey New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little pink rumor that says women are not fun, and they find quite fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the New York Festival New York City Festival in her 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and when you just remind the edge of the <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma in disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the <unk> news program by <unk> Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduate dance if I went to a graduate dance I sat down to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I hold on my desk from the host to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like a full-time participant and pasted my chair.
Something that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never get away from me or no older girl.
Suddenly my online disability became the object of <unk>
I would hear online clips in comments like, "Why <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite favorite, <unk> <unk>
What disease does it have?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If anybody in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media, but I don't think they <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that's less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we need all the society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> of <unk> a charity to give kids refugee refugee -- a little bit of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small village to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives a small village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
No for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunity, there is no work, nor <unk>
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
Maybe a year -- nothing.
One day he gets about a man who offered him to take him back after dinner, and then for dinner, to <unk>
He knows a small group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
They present to a young guy.
He finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That little boy from that small village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were in the <unk> a connected organization to al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a young people trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came to him.
This was the first thing that we call it as the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> urban <unk> who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity of opportunity, but the young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities -- the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terror, to violence, to <unk> will be the story of renewable cities.
And in my city of birth, 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, don't go to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I never had he gone?
And if I'd been forced to be forced to be in that same <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some juvenile leaders at a business edge.
Tell a few younger leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had an idea of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because I was a college college college college was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other consumer organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
It began <unk> motorcycle residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the <unk> spirit and I think the entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
He was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic to the <unk>
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those of those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for wedding themselves, creating gardens in the houses, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and, as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing rose because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that you might be businesspeople, that might be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
We inspected business solutions for local problems.
So, we inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit -- it's really a great step, but the young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to engage in development and put in their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need to do, they need the support they need to move from conception to creation, to create the <unk> of the urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Its Park of <unk> this is how it calls it when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help to rent and maintain motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs who are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is: to become young people in businesspeople, and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area in northern New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the way that we were <unk> almost we could pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> <unk> with a beautiful Lake Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> of about four square feet with the heart of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy too lazy to get what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and he would take a little bit.
Who's clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where do you get <unk> who cleans your garbage in <unk>
Who cleans our garbage in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, <unk> of waste and two tons of waste products every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel to use the uniform and get that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more.
So I started to work like garbage <unk>
Now I don't just travel in the trucks. And I have them <unk>
And operated the <unk> <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody wonders about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as they believe, and in the days that it is very strong you would get quickly <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies continue to save the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage every weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> collection is one of the ten <unk> most dangerous ones in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out in traffic and moving into traffic all day and pass through all around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And the garbage is also full of dangers that often fall out of the truck, and they have terrible damage.
I also learned about how relentless in the trash.
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
You never stop coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always must be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I think the <unk> <unk> are the most important hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in efficient and effective <unk> every day, this starts to take away from their containers and their dangers inherent in very real ways.
For decades, we had controlled for decades, and centuries come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have room for what the engines of economics start to fail when it's endangered percent.
I'm not advocating that capitalism, just pointing their relationship.
And then there's what I call our average speed that we need.
I mean just at the speed of the speed that used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't get ourselves and <unk> and we had our cup of coffee, our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, we forget them, we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that will take for it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and focus on that conversation about how to design a sustainable and sustainable city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you're going.
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always must stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> collection truck on the street, grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycling <unk> as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for making her work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be good.
Let's be OK."
Shortly after that I began to investigate the collection of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> We work together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to define the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have to account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor labor.
The city waste, what we think when we talk about trash, represent the three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next time you see someone whose job whose job is to clean the garbage -- you give them a moment to get it off.
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture is naturally born from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and another in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall for several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example of my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out there?
So after seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city -- we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to spend a lot of energy because the <unk> of the <unk> it generates heat in the interior, so you have a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the whole year.
And thirdly, he looks like it has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a mistake for a place so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually enchanted with old market with old market structure where thousands of people, go and buy stuff every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a <unk> building of several stories, by applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site of the site, which is located in a very long area of the city, where much of the buildings that we see in the image, not exist in the image.
And it's also between two parallel streets that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, linking all the hits of the building.
And this extends out of a <unk> atrium, that creates a space in the open air in the building that goes into its shape and the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that will lead to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue that was similar to a concrete shell, in order to allow the input of air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model <unk>
We're building that with these little little pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside of the building.
This is attached to these little tiny crystals of colors that use the light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It was not what he <unk>
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the mall was much more profitable than the shopping center because they had the end of bank accounts.
And the idea of the facade was a lot more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is just almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water for the heads of the inside.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the biggest thing that I have to do, he needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
So during that analysis I put special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access doors around straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets in existing streets, creating 12 similar initial blocks in size and features that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a different thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So you make a scheme that ensures that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these <unk> blocks and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set a greater density at higher levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community of the space that is occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can get up and <unk> and do activities such as a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes to local communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have to connect nature with people with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had large amounts of hair and a small <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I had <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed a time after the <unk> I was a little sooner and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took from my teacher to my master's book <unk>
And then, I did.
I put on the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just some Like this.
All the way --  And I set out to give back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows out of <unk> and myself a row of that, just for being there, because he got to go.
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It was that it was pretty obvious that it was <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I was given to me, the reason why I was bothered by this little girl who was so small to get it out of it.
I was <unk> by jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
There are no primates. The birds are tiles very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab that you study <unk> in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, <unk> there would be also literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
You wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I had a high school lists of high school, because we'd be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> or <unk> We would have no <unk>
<unk> there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, I almost have all of them.
This year has been 100 years of his masterpiece, "In search of time -- the most <unk> study of the sex <unk> and also my ordinary <unk> my God, all we could possibly have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of it, right?
We think of a kid trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in your <unk>
We forget how hard that image is.
We forget how relentless it is.
That is, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how it is <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the jealousy, that are reduced by the person that is reduced to their wish, to their <unk> they are a well-known narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being a while storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details are going on to peg the <unk> right?
<unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that <unk> understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give us pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- he adds it to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break out with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> you like big amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is as successful --  <unk> links very well <unk> language from jealousy.
When <unk> is in the <unk> agony of soon listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are searching for knowledge, search for truth, an incredibly painful truth, in fact, to what we were going to do, the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to do, that makes us suffer, it causes us to become a range of much more profound feelings and vital than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at with such <unk> intensity as well.
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud visited by a young woman who was consumed with the idea that his wife would get it.
And Freud said that there was something weird about that man, who didn't care about what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everyone knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or do not accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
The novels describe very well how the <unk> make us look in intensity, but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts of illegal acts of it.
<unk> are moving us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for the age of eight, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
One woman of Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from the one that was sent by <unk> <unk> for one year.
For one year. Every year.
She was trying to get her to the new girlfriend of her former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How big even though it comes to creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She is a very strange and brilliant character from American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are trying to understand how the jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or wanting what you have to be aware of you and <unk> what you ever get, and it's under the floor -- you're under the floor -- you're wearing your rings, your empty bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route by Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in the time of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of <unk> Street and ask, by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> thinking about the <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always experienced <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius <unk>
Oh, my hair sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it would be <unk> and <unk> in the fall of mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> <unk> once in <unk> <unk> once in his solution, <unk> goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no one person in <unk> <unk> who I wouldn't want to get your hands on.
It's one of the times one of the times that I see <unk> relocated in history. It looks like this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you are on the same side.
Suddenly, they would be able to admire that idea of being he <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to take it from the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk>
So while we hope that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Just fiction <unk> jealousy.
The fiction used to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, in 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and descended on the Beaufort Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence on the gray surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, of which greeted the death of Armstrong -- last year, it's now the most <unk>
So why would you care?
They didn't come up with a lot of old <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that sold them 24 later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is, because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the name of <unk> at University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F.
Why do we turn it into our goal?
And you might also ask, why would the mountain scale up the <unk>
35 years ago, why would you fly over the <unk>
Why is it playing Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the Moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West over the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> by the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was really great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a long context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century, there was the assembly line and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and was eliminated <unk>
Technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a candle ship, but in 1969, the crew of the Apollo 10 flew 20 miles / hour.
From 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> by seeing that the problems that we imagine that the technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy -- cure cancer, or feeding the world's population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the <unk> tube from the rocket <unk> Saturn Saturn at all?
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that happens, it occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists have found us <unk> and they had enriched trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks or algorithms that speed up the sale of <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't follow the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in the Silicon Valley, which are <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years in which they are <unk> Intel and Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley is that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs for risk.
Silicon Valley said that the risk investment caused the creation of <unk> ideas for funding problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly goes wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the capitalists of risk were at their high point without worrying about the risk of risk, it's small investment investment that they could go out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit in technologies like energy, which need massive capital and development that they need is a huge term and development that has been in the long term -- they have never invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have any immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and deeper problems.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you are."
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that is popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't fix the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption came from sources of renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at price.
Now, the technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties are according to the development of <unk> energy, a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in political climate that we're going to see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that they looked like technological, they're not to be.
We know for the time that famines are result of failure in the delivery of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affects <unk> food distribution.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and food handling of food, but there will be famines while bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many types of cancer, some highly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have been finding effective and effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can have it, but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem: institutions have to support the problem, because it was really a <unk> problem and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, is true with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decline in trust, it's a very widespread beliefs.
The second is a <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think it's <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I bow to think that there may be falling down in some of the activities or institutions and that might have risen on others.
I have no clear.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
That is, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago still being quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway through.
But this is enough?
What the record opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is <unk> attitudes that people would solve when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> on the <unk> teachers.
You probably want to be asking, "What does what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust a some, but in other people don't.
It's really rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> officer or a person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, saying I trust a certain teacher of elementary school I know to give the type of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why do we leave the whole knowledge when we think about trust in the most <unk> way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they try to find good inherent in the fact that we trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's an stupid.
That's not the goal that I would have to do.
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what it is to trust, but not what it is.
In short, I'm <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who are taking their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it, he says, yes, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is making a judgment of how attractive people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if you find that one person is <unk> in the raw materials, and it's responsible and I will have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but I don't want them to get a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see it <unk> your own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If that is, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're looking at most of us to do before trust.
Trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and people and so forth, that they made them easier to judge their reliability.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make <unk> <unk> which I attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we found that the system of accountability is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the testing tests actually is doing the opposite.
What they're doing is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like <unk> <unk> that we call them <unk> as we say.
You probably all know that you know similar examples.
They put all of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we think things would be worthy of trust and <unk> the people that we are reliable and whether to try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the <unk> the simple actions, the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
We put things to the task to reconstruct the confidence, it puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, trying to improve trust.
But the confidence in short, it's defining because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> usually to all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to make sure that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, do the common people, <unk> institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where my socks bought my socks said I can tell you, without giving us creative.
I take them back and get it back for the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and trust what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people rely on is the relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the early computers we've been <unk> we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
I first created this tool that gets deeper into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers their physical body to the pixels.
Designers can take their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool is breaking the barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the divide of Science <unk> of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
It would take a transparent display with cameras to detect your fingers and face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and emphasize lines or words with the online touch sensor that is below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us will be bought and researching things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is an online <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make them be physicists so that we can be able to be treated and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, that we created this only physical universe.
This magnet, <unk> acts like an pixel in 3D space, which means that so much the computer like users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
We <unk> what we did is we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of the <unk> the <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And the digitally programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and far distance and famous by Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the motion of the planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to protect us from our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you took that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was afraid to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1950s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believe strongly that there was only an effective path toward <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter if the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer was a Chinese opera singer, man.
This was me, on my imaginary piano.
An opera singer should start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more <unk>
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness would be the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> Okay.
Let's go to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I miss <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
<unk> Good <unk> it's about life <unk>
And it's not <unk> convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a subject to another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> trap. and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave me a place in my reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I would never have occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like comparative religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and policies and <unk>
For the Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> Road <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  Instead of getting lost in the translation, I found that you can get a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and present.
I know I'm not going to be used or powerless before.
Having a dream was actually <unk> nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, of where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Until a dream was <unk> can do that for you.
And it's because of books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a woman named <unk>
Alex came into the first session using jeans and a <unk> encountered on the sofa of my office and took off my shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could manage it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> became easy just to move the head while we were going to bring the solution.
<unk> <unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I looked like, she was right.
You start to work later, they start to work after, she has children later, to death after.
For educated as Alex and I had plenty of time.
But soon after that, my <unk> camp pushed me to push Alex who talk about his life <unk>
I was hooked.
I said, "Yeah, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like being married with him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe you get to the next.
Also, the best time to work on marriage marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment <unk>
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel their head after what they were, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of benign recklessness was a real problem and had real consequences -- not only to Alex and her life lives, but for the careers, the families and the future <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million women in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to adulthood without going to go through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your dream -- I want to see. It's fine. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
This means that eight out of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments -- that give her life to have happened to be 30 and <unk>
<unk> of more than 40, I don't get <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money they <unk>
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and the last stage of growth in its <unk> and it becomes <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change yourself, it's now the time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the time to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who gets <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what women are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes at the line of time from <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence of an extended child.
The journalists called the <unk> names to the overweight and <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it?
What do you think happens when you get a <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it is absolutely nothing.
And then every day, every day, intelligent intelligent ones, interesting as you or your children are coming into my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not true. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "All they say is that as I start a race before 30, everything will be OK."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better admire the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My dating during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running, and they were <unk> but then at some point about 30, it turned to the music and everybody began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing to be <unk> so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but it doesn't look like the stakes are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure on 30 and so many of you will start a career, to choose a city, to choose a city, to pick a spouse, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's a research that starts to show you, which is a lot harder and stressful stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want to do now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I sit in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he thinking?"
I want to change what women are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper to live with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very hard time, his previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often going on in our <unk> but then she woke up to her, and they say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose their friends."
Well, one day she got her head on her legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many contacts, but then you stayed looking at the empty space that follows after the words -- "In the emergency case, please call <unk>
I was about <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of it if I get <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot to resist not to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which is actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex and Alex as to Alex as well as the <unk> <unk>
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told her Emma that he was aware of that identity crisis and the identity capital of identity.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the career of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity creates capital of identity.
So now it's time for the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration -- I'm <unk> the exploration that I should not count, which, by the way, is not <unk>
It's <unk>
I told her to explore jobs and he would do it.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to get you to the airport, but the women who get together with friends with similar minds are merely limited to who you know, what they know how they think about, how they think about, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out of almost always comes from outside of the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak ties friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the women have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak ties are the shape of <unk> to this group.
The half of the work that I created never had, then meeting the boss of your neighbor is the way you get a job of a job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
By the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know her friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon loved her family, when they have a partner and form her own family.
I told Emma the time to choose her family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to get your mind than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person who you live right now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook start walking towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and it involves being so <unk> in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just to do it work or kill your time with anyone who's going to get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with the one that he alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married guy with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new career, and I send a letter that said, "Now the emergency properties of emergency contact spaces are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes who come out of the airport of Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21, or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good day, a good TED Talk, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea worthy of spreading all the mammal you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have now the privilege of telling adults as Emma every day, <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> his <unk> get your identity and use their ties -- weak connections, choose your family.
You don't know how they didn't know what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in management management for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I was to teach them mathematics to high school <unk> in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I took tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When I work back, they would save grades.
What I called the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a better performance did not have credit I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was really convinced that every single one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time.
And after several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
But what happens if you succeed in school and life is dependent on much more than the ability to learn in a rapid and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk>
We're trying to predict what to be <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really hard neighborhoods -- and what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school and of <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with private companies, what about what of these marketers are going to hold their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, there emerged a feature as a major <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and wasn't <unk>
It was the <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not just for the week, not only for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my determination questionnaires and then waited around more than a year to see who were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly bigger likely to <unk> even when they were <unk> in every single feature that I was able to measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the safety they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> <unk> where it matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know how little science knows about it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development is <unk>
What do I have to do to teach children a good job of work?
How do I keep them through the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is the talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of gifted individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, that is commonly related to it or is that we are commonly related to backwards as talented as well.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing <unk> is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, you are much more likely to <unk> when they get to <unk> because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have at the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to begin to begin with all of new things with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most favorite memories -- is my mother <unk> beauty, the shape and shape of Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was interested in this incredible language.
But for a week, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been asking if I can break down this <unk> so that whoever is that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five, I began to learn how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than let's do it in a faster and faster.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic belief.
The first 200 of us will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read traffic signals, <unk> <unk> understanding the basic idea of the Web or the newspapers.
Today we start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you might be able to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were yelling at <unk> I am <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> the shape called, but I like to believe it's the other way.
This is a tree.
It tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors in the old West west.
I call a radical <unk>
They are building blocks so that they create many more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old saying, two are company, two are company, three are a crowd.
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a divergence as a <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
You put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of them.
Put a mouth over the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> -- because a flat tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two nations together, it's very hot.
Three passes together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
And put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes over the horizon.
One door. Get a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
Did you have somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
When we use this method, the first eight <unk> will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, they will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the first one, because Japan is in this China.
So a sun next to us, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my father is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie is <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to wear a brilliant dress.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children into a kind of industrial complex, child's fantasy show.
However, the magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took the rise for 40 years later with, interestingly, another film called <unk> a little metal whose metal and a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl in an enemy of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the recipe for Oz is actually done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
We have magical shoes to beat the North <unk> of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing of the magician of Oz is that the most amazing characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son too.
Only three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance was <unk>  And so slid in the room and was impressed as a leg of my <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be themes of value, perseverance and <unk>
I should feel the feeling that Luke got one to an army for overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the magician of <unk>
How does the film?
In order to do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, and not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much of the <unk> capital force, in the movies for our children, and so little of the road in <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence on the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know of experience that the princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that had served to be able to navigate through the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first sentence I really expected to be able to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My quest have finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why still stand there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on beating the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and I stand up to <unk> from Disney to any of you.
But they send the message to the kids, although they guys, they are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to protect the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend from <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times is still coming up in classic <unk> each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raised a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, it finally came out.
I recommend you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passes the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't yet broken roots and already <unk> but maybe today today a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book scientist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend on the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There's only three questions that have to be <unk> in the film, there's more than one female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than you like it?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things to each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I really rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality movie, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success of a consensus of what is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen the <unk> test.
And I don't think it <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the crisis of <unk>
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Go to bed -- <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, in the 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have actors who are <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage of women who have been elected recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a bigger number that goes to <unk> this room.
The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said:
One in five women says that it's been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't believe that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics -- one of the things I think is there's a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is beat the <unk> with violence and then collecting the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are tracking that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to get it out.
We have tools to our willingness to be <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You've read about how new economics is changing the role that you care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite Star character was <unk> Do you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to engage their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I tell my <unk> <unk> and I fight only and more stories where they see that his work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked was looking for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would get back to <unk>
I started to see ways and patterns that helped me help me.
This became a passion for finding things, in love through the past and archeology.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I can see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of roughly 1.3 miles of length along the <unk>
And my chunks had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when you use the <unk>
This is a place in the East <unk> in Egypt called <unk>
And the place, the simple eye seems to be brown but when we use infrared and process using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape of building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old city city, called <unk> -- lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old capital of Egypt for over 400 years in a time time called the Middle East about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle World, there was this great renaissance of old art -- architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this enormous continuous <unk>
This area is huge. It's about <unk> miles per square miles.
Before, the Nile right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved into this and covered all the city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find it at random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball gloves with.
So, we use NASA data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly bigger area that you see inside the circle here, we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation,
Five feet down, below a thick layer, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of <unk> several hundred years to date from the Middle World, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found jobs of <unk> <unk> and <unk> what shows that there was a <unk>
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in jewelry, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes from the Middle Ottoman Empire
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry workshop who shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still haven't yet been <unk> here, but we would take place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also do great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Bank, probably written in <unk> four years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So according to TED it wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually started in 1984 <unk> C. <unk> in a lost city not long and found from high school.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door to <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that he's made.
Now let's take a group of <unk> <unk>
They're competing on a race and bicycles and go into their front door.
I need you to look at this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of their house.
There's bicycles flying around, wheels that go on its side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- <unk> the gate, <unk>
The <unk> in the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the door, and watch the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that you're talking about.
Can you feel your blue <unk> making it tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you get that it's about to get into your mouth.
<unk> on one side and enter their living room.
Already in the room, and making the peak of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing over his head <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now I go to the kitchen.
The ground has been covered with a yellow and yellow way from the oven.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages of different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers just looking at them once.
The names of tens and dozens of strangers.
It took whole poems for just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I am not a wise.
I have a average memory.
Everybody who's involved with this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using a few two years ago, invented years ago in Greece, the same techniques that they used <unk> to memorize their addresses, and that the medieval <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> how did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant English person, but a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American hero.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of film in living TV on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year -- not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> He based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, a number of treaties on the writing of writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Latin, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory and disciplined and <unk> was not a very rare thing as you can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed the decline and I would say that they have changed also cognitive demands.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this particular competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from London invited me to a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some sense, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're even smarter than <unk>
They gave them a battery battery battery, and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control with that <unk>
When they put them in a <unk> MRI scanner, you get your brains while we were <unk> numbers, faces and shapes of snow <unk> that they found that in memory champions are located parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or they looked like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is driving as an armed race where every year is someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times <unk>
In his desk, and in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who's about to try to memorize it in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all of the techniques used by the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
So this is illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox -- which is the following: I say two people who remember the same word, I'm saying to you, <unk> that there's a man called <unk>
That's her <unk>
And then I ask you, "You know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
So what do you do?
The person who was told that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who was told that his work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity. That's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name, Baker, actually doesn't mean for you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They do well when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you look at that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point back.
One of the most elaborate techniques in doing this goes back two years ago, in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if he wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up on foot, <unk> his poem from memory, and he was <unk> and so soon it was, the classroom.
They were going to move everyone.
But not only killed them all, but it shattered the bodies.
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
And so they could not be able to <unk> the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He was standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed my eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting on.
I took the family of <unk> hand where their loved ones were between the rubble.
What you would have noticed at the time is something that we all know about more or less <unk> and it is no matter whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual and spatial memory.
If you let me tell you that I would tell you, the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told you to tell you who was sitting on the brown horse in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with your mind and <unk> from images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first teaching of memory <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it -- the same way I had done it <unk> if they had been invited to <unk> it 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous image -- crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine coming into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they walked in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they talk about would be that strange journey that made for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the <unk> speakers are <unk> the word <unk> which is going to confuse you, typical of the typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about the <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of space in space.
The phrase <unk> it would be like the first place in your memory palace
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got to get away with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something extensive about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Seriously, is like looking at a lot of people sitting by taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody else comes up with the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put me in place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning before sitting at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. -- or the names of an ancient school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was fun.
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What is actually about doing is to make it better and better the ability to create and imagine these fictional images, <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a <unk> <unk> with tape just leaves two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a <unk> of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before, I had the idea that I could sort of <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just tricks.
Because they're based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> of <unk> to benefit with a little bit of insights about how your mind works.
We're often talking about people with a great memory of people as if it was a gift of it, but it's not the case.
Great memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on to deeply.
The palace of memory, these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing kind of processing -- a kind of complete attention that most is not <unk>
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today is what I would say to you today -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our short <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks into our side -- we will be so <unk> that we don't even care about processing in <unk>
I learned from first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life you must be from the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject, so we can just take a place -- New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, I had six years old, and I lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom as a child.
In the corner, since my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all sitting there in the television line, so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, and I all saw me and I would go back and I would go back and I would go back to a <unk>
And I was like this.
It was <unk> safe and hated it.
He <unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, not of division of areas, but of those emotional emotional connections, that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising we feel like this, because according to the Climate Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines it in ways that we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell you, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what you think about based on a building done two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an ongoing emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, in America, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we met with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the <unk> Public Library. I ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> has this kind of <unk> columns, red brick and the red brick -- that they leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> kids, the values of ownership -- the values of the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library in today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, two buildings, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side there is the <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new new technologies, new solutions for today's life.
We were able to do it and we got it out so much that we get out of the people.
All black, this will give us up, you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to the other side and connect these symbols.
So we do, and we're all happy, but we started to experiment with <unk> so we started experimenting with <unk> we started to swing the concert back forward, over and over again. So we've done this over the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 300 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> years ago.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Something really really hard.
So we get to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We put the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know that I like and <unk>
We <unk> and we added bake to bake a new material for new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we converted them into a skyscraper that can be <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won on boldness and <unk>
<unk> became the columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend time in commercial centers, and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic erotic fantasies in the suburbs,
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian or Italian.
They may not have a <unk> of <unk>
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we visualize memories from other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and started to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new design techniques that have been on the computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that we are going on against other ways.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum ticking. again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk> happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's <unk> <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical scholars and public and general scholars were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in two and a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media would spread around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes were meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
He did the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennium studies happened with other voluntary architects.
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the back of the new millennium, actually began to go through the entire architecture, media media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Imagine, for example, how do you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> can be <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't be accurate long to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before knowing whether that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we met buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That will never happen to happen. Because we're on the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of steel or <unk> and is the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, the media, starts to swing faster and faster, to get in both extremes of <unk> almost in <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, and the <unk> of us, the architects and you, the public.
Now we can do symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge, something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly the same stuff, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became an amounts of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by charge these symbols, we are learning.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media haven't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can bring the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there's no unique response to what is a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and you're no longer a <unk> audience, who don't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum pendulum from one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical brick in ideas of what it should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will spread to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami in Florida, Florida, it can also serve to do sport or to <unk> or even you can get married at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community connected around that cause, no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion of <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to see.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
Architects already know how to do buildings more and more <unk> more <unk>
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we are no longer opposite place.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to do better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
Buildings don't only reflect our society, but they give it to the most <unk> spaces, the local libraries of the homes where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he already started walking.
And it makes it out of that cool way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is look <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughing and <unk> and it feels like these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And then made me think, when stop doing this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people looking at Google. "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, there's a little confused because, although his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him it's ugly.
Among what his mom says and what his friends, or friends from school, they say, doesn't know who you believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others who please let for a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it's not even worth thinking about them.
We talk about a healthy healthy teenager, who gets these answers on one of the stages of their most vulnerable lives emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing to do this?
Well, the teenagers of today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure on being online and available all the time, talking, giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before, we've never been so connected, in a continuous way, so young people.
As a mother told me, "It's like a party <unk> all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment of being connected is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of people's <unk> and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no divide between a live line and real life.
It's really hard to know the difference between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is the uses of digitally.
What is the greatest thing in someone else's life in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young young people.
But the kids are not immune to this.
And like the <unk> <unk> stars and the singers who are <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and individuals are very <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to look at their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities -- their studies and other aspects to be hurt.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for us as human beings, and as human beings and the business of the labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class.
One of five are not attending at all at the end of the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season for tests, if you don't think you see it well, specifically if you don't think you're <unk> enough, you have a note less than the average of your peers who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it works independently of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be clear, we're talking about as you see you, not how you're really like.
<unk> on their body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they are involved in healthier diet than they can bring to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily overwhelmed by people around the surrounding and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's because of all of this because they make more reproductive decisions like alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic surgery, aesthetic relationships to early ages and no protection and damage and damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing to the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they have no greater <unk> rates.
17 percent of women are present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that try?
And this potential is for interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes -- the first one is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teens to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are still not just going to have a positive impact, but also an impact <unk>
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key <unk> The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be starting to give you an education education that works.
One education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue and be a better model to keep in the women and girls in our own lives.
It challenging the current status of how women are seen and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of its <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people on what they are, not because they can see.
We can begin to start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published on our social networks.
We can encourage people based on their effort, and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to really change our culture, so that our children grow up to to grow their entire person, valuing the individuality, of <unk> diversity, <unk>
We have to put people who are actually marking the difference in a <unk>
And let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them be those who come out of the great screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they see that they are never going to be <unk> of being those who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who is your mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
His <unk> At his <unk>
Could it just be the woman who is at two car seats -- what would it mean for her if he released from that <unk> voice in his interior, which he would tell him for not having long legs -- more <unk> a <unk> <unk> feet more little <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this and we would take advantage of their potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is helping us all.
But let's get our children to the truth.
We argue that the way you see you is only one part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
They went to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that small <unk> for a year of age today, become agents of insurance agents in themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The five of November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
Now, initially initially the innocent thing were, but being prisoner for other charges in the company of others, started planning attacks at about 12 New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were <unk> by an FBI <unk> from the FBI.
Sadly, the California bomb in the World Trade Center could not escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, as he was an engineer who had a <unk> engineer with a <unk> American mother, high school elementary school at the two did all the way to give me a happy childhood, me.
Just when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to know.
And I saw that when people take time to interact and don't need a lot to want to want to want the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in every human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who are going to become so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that we have to use all the possible media for everyone living like them.
A few months before arrest him he sat with me and explained to me that in the last few weekends, he and some friends had been doing training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with it the next day.
We got to the shot of <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet I shot he gave up to the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise you, especially mine, all the goal in flames.
My uncle went back to others and Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
All of all, the comment took a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be infected by putting a van loaded with 700 pounds of explosives in the northern tower in the North Trade Center -- causing a explosion that killed six people and injured other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had now moved 20 times. That instability in my childhood did not let me do a lot of <unk>
Every time I began to feel comfortable about someone is a moment of packing and go to another town.
As I always was the new side of the class that often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> <unk> my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new kind of class -- quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent my house reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not develop social skills, to put it very <unk> for <unk> <unk> not prepared for the real world.
And I was passionate about opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put to test my way to think, was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National Geographic Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence -- as I had been a victim of <unk> almost all of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids who had done friendship, was Jewish people.
I took a number of days to go to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of being able to beat the barrier that all life had been made to believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer job in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life had been taught that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, every gay man was bad <unk>
I happened to have a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the closest and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a little bit of a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind of like I would have been treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is to be homosexual but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me become <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation has nothing to do with character.
In many ways he became my shape <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence on my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that keeps my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and started a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I have done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is about taking the violence, I can hear my story and to understand that there is a better way -- than even though I gave myself to this violent ideology.
Instead, I decided to use my experience to fight against terrorism and <unk>
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has made them in their lives.
By the victims of the state of terrorism talking, against those acts without sense, as rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow their parents' roads.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that gets projects in your minds.
It's an incredible <unk>
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has smell, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your life."
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It's got memories, like your childhood moments that project into your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal internal movie, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know I have a <unk>
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of anything in our lives, it would have sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these movies <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to make to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
science, by nature, it's objective of objective itself.
<unk> by nature, is subjective things.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we would get that vision.
The psychology of studying behavioral behavior, the neuroscience was studying the brain <unk> but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything began to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for the science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this guy in the fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain to me that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do with what certain areas of the brain are going to be like.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There's actually no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real <unk> <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk> movie there.
Right now, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's just give neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all instances of emerging behaviors, how the <unk> work, how the <unk> work are adapted and <unk> the living organisms -- they're all questions about how they work.
That could be apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how to address how we speak, how we play <unk> all of these things are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's all accompanied with a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for us to have been <unk>
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations for us -- great. We get used to this; physics explains chemistry, chemistry accounts for biology, biology, accounts for biology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how to seat that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need some ideas that at the beginning, <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific fashion.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
The crazy idea is that there is no such a difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- and this is studies everything that needs to <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the end, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as expensive building space, space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and fundamental laws don't explain in terms of any more basic stuff.
Instead, you think of principles, and it builds up the world.
Sometimes, the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, <unk> mass laws -- so I applied the basic laws of <unk> and I applied the electrical load as a fundamental concept that those laws will bring.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space mass, <unk> <unk> then for a matter of logic, you have to have a <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> the awareness itself as a fundamental <unk> of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's suddenly not the object of science.
It opens up the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, the mass of the physical.
The physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple that we can get them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can tell them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everybody, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies, even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when he thinks <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some element of crude raw feeling -- some <unk> precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would someone think something so <unk>
Some of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental to do.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful shape of finding fundamental laws that we would think of thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
So there's always information processing.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, very complex.
<unk> simple information, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk>
In a mouse there is an information integration of information, as a pretty significant degree of consciousness rather important.
But when you get to the gender worms, the microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The information integration of information is minor but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually gives you a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies the reality behind it.
As Stephen Hawking, <unk> "Where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision is, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical implications.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think it would think about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral terms, it's not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have a pretty serious ethical problems about the ethic of intelligent computers and smart computers and the ethical <unk>
And finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or on a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk, we have a collective collective consciousness, an inner film for this whole TED group for this whole TED group from each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second is universal.
So vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right way towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we're finally going to figure it out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in Victoria.
I had a very normal, <unk> profile.
I went to school, I joined the school with my friends, I loved my sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to give it for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's really nice -- but there is a real problem.
She was actually not <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile on the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, yeah. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as an achievement if we took the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching school in a high school in <unk> and just about 20 minutes in the middle of <unk> <unk> a guy lifted her hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about Moore's Law for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk>
When people are talking about wheels, they talk about things that were <unk> at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this boy had had experiences with people with disabled objects.
And we don't. And it's not because of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there for inspiring.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to tell them right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid, <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lied to disability.
Yes, they have been sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A cap <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't make you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may have seen one, the girl without drawing the drawing of the drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with carbon fiber legs.
And there are a lot of these images, which are what we call the inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term <unk> because we had a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> people in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, as bad as my life might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times in the number of times that have been trained me to express that I am a brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images would apply to people with disabled people with no disabilities.
They're there so that you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually hard.
So let's get some things.
But the things that we overcome is not the things that you can think.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was calling it by called a social model of disability, that tells us that we are more <unk> because of society we live than because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
The things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of his ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common thing.
They're just using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold this lie that disability makes us quite exceptional us a lot.
And honestly, he doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by something inspired by business.
And I actually know that I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't think I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to load the phone battery on the battery on your chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance to others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: <unk> in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of the stairs hasn't made it never become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen will not turn the subtitles <unk> for the <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not deemed no <unk> of anything for being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we will be <unk> by getting away from bed and remembering our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the disabled people, and I want to live in a world where a boy from 11 grade in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average speed of <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just responding to one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of <unk> <unk> thinking about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional professional, in the countryside.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to figure it out.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would take with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what's running through the game of the game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man from 110 pounds of <unk> trying to <unk> all of his being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I would take some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices, because the idea of the <unk> of the emerging technology is an submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
<unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
You fans want that experience.
You fans want to be in the field, it's going to be their favorite players, and they have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk> field.

We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, are how we get <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which you probably had a lot of you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus -- and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, thank you.
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man on a roller coaster -- he was taking care of his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan line, the <unk> of a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan.
When it can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball to the bottom of the network?  Or, <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of <unk> for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality reality when the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> in his field <unk> so that he played faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed radios in the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that it's a player coming back to your group, and you see your next move shown in front of you in a plastic display that you carry on on it, you have no longer have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or because the strategy.
They're just coming into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose games like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual of <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to gather information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every single corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
evil will have information <unk>
This will be good teams of bad equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and analysis of data will stop being <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
So how would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
Do you have the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receptor. Suddenly a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you goes to <unk> Normally, but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
It <unk> the protection.
Another <unk> you'll tell you, there's an open receiver
<unk> the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, however, the receptor sees their display an area of grass that's lighting up and can change the career.
He <unk> catching the <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something to create massive emotion in the game.
So I'm going to try lots of people to see it, because people want to live that experience.
You fans want to be in the field.
You want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable for not to be.
But what I ask you is: we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk> <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face is the always, of us.
Thank you.
It was recently <unk> after 23 years of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago I spent the southern end of the county in <unk> County, which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> an engineer head of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from its openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take another dimension, and this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that every one of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used for suicide.
After a fall of four to five seconds, the body bumps against water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is broken by bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones that don't normally get rid of in the <unk> water and then <unk>
I don't think that the ones who are doing this method of suicide will take away from death -- they will realize that they are <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, you have 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
So here is where most people have to take away their lives.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darker time, it's very hard to bring you back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an officer reading his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we succeeded in that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal formal training.
So let's try to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> suicide, but officers, too.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, Palestinian officers and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met it the 22 <unk> of last year when they receive a call of a suicide guy suicide was sitting on the cords near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I watched Jason talking to an official from the Golden Gate bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown down here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown down here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He was stopped by <unk> leaned on the right, and left.
And this kind of a smart guy in New Jersey had just taken her life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, her family rabbi called me to see how it was.
<unk> parents had to do it.
<unk> damage to a ton of people.
I put these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What do you do?
So what about that?
In my experience, it's not only to speak, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels feel, because they probably didn't get it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have you thought to end up your life, you've had these <unk>
They hit the person in front of the face and they can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, belief that things are terrible, and they never go to <unk> -- to believe that there is nothing you can do with <unk> social isolation, and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and like to read your letter.
She lost his son on January <unk> this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go on to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking to your friends to tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of the 49 with her father the 19 of January.
It never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and they <unk> it as well as that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the car from Mike was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without suffering a real mental illness.
It should not be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean by hope and value.
On March 11, I wrote to a radio call by a drone called a drone guy on the sidewalk near the bridge near the northern tower.
I <unk> my bike. and I watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and a half two, I heard like Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day to go back to that lane and give it to the other chance.
When Kevin stepped down, I opened it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was what he did to <unk> and gave her the hope and life again.
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to get it to you.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of March 11, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin continues with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness which has been properly <unk>
I heard Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, like he says.
We give God thanks to you.
I was going to be at debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And in the end, she write, <unk> when I visited the General at San Francisco at the night, you were going to be like the patient.
I had to get it to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a dream of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and his depression with hope that his story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of its own pain, I theft, the chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, would you wouldn't think of somebody else.
They simply want their own pain to be.
Usually this is achieved only three things: sleep or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've answered and have been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls about the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been involved with, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other was a man who talked about about an hour.
And during that time, I got her hand on three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact with the bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few people who have jumped from the bridge and lived and can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second they leave side the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or that connection that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should work on to work on.
Oil can prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but on your inside, you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you focus on that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone at any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever been from a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I'm going to refer to later, when I look at this picture -- I'm thinking, <unk> -- <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just getting started.
We were all providing our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of skin or because of the beliefs of those around us.
They're people who are always going to challenge the status quo, which is what's considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is my own.
I had recorded as <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom was going, "Why always take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to do it.
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, it's more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never loved to share my story, not because it thought I'm going to be bad, but why the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have my mom, Dad and a family who embrace me as I am.
Many of them are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a contest <unk>
And that night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for <unk> <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in a bathroom suit, I won in a <unk> and third finalist among over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was from queen of women <unk> but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they moved to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all of that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mother, who had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that I passed my request from the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was hooked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you get to the United States, you can change the name and your identity <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I emailed my name.
She also accompanied me when I was met in Thailand at age 19.
It's funny that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most rural and sophisticated surgeries of <unk>
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before they changed the name of the name of the name of the name of the name.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of the <unk> and the female <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many of them are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living his truth, but he was <unk> in order to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 November, we do a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I am on this stage because of a long history of people who are <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth, and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> for one day no more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
You will do it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. Sure. First of all, thank you with all my <unk>
My parents of my support network, my parents especially, my family, which itself is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been <unk> and some times, when they were called me and they told me that their parents couldn't take it, and he would take the phone, he called my mom and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it would work, sometimes it's not gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the theme that sometimes that task -- not block, and that should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice <unk> Thank you.
In many societies, and tribal societies and tribal parents usually know about their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when he was monitoring his efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you put a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of violence, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when birth was a child, his birth is not <unk>
It's not dancing, nor for his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes next to her, and she <unk> the mother and no one to the father.
And a mother would become a lot like having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When she gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a child, when he was watching his third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only have the mother dead, but the daughter <unk> daughter is growing up as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays home and a school admits of his brothers.
Until 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
It can be <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move on the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, he is beating out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
He becomes a so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that honor, and it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this kind of honor code is not only affecting the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more standard of <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl is supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
That's the judgment.
The model of a good girl has to be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embracing people's decisions and mother and mother decisions, even if you don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like it, or if she was <unk> with an old man, she has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, he has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her children.
And this vicious cycle goes on and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborn to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so before I was thinking, I thought in his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter like this.
But when I was released, everyone was men, and I grabbed my pen, <unk> a line of my name, and wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half years ago I was going on in my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for a child's life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of your identity and his name.
One task at school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I was <unk> the form of tourist <unk> and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
You know, I would sit down with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to show them in his personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all of these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
I took my daughters, I taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, paid for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation in women in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were <unk>
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years old, he stood up and raised on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, and he was offered to the documentaries of the New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It's <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign, and the nine o'clock in October 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would tell my wife to my wife -- "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't give you up.
<unk> the fair cause.
He <unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of peace, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot for me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had harsh headaches because his facial nerve, because his facial nerve, was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that would spread across the face of my wife.
But my daughter will never meet.
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile with <unk> and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to give you well. Please don't go away.
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women -- it's like any <unk>
<unk> when he doesn't have a task.
I fight with his siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is some special <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I tell you, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain for 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined me with the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> -- but all the work I'm going to talk today about here about the science of the brain, I made it before I come to Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you hit a brain operation when you get into a brain operation before.
Are you just smart or not?
Don't be like that, you will be smart.
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, of more than a dozen chemical powerful chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to get it to live with life.
More than once I saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would take you to try to get the doses -- because it really doesn't have a map of course that says it in <unk>
I started to try and get slightly different <unk> and I was amazed by how small the little changes in the dose, dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly controversial case for a few months, I was <unk> and typical chemical doses for a twentieth man, and I was surprised by looking at how I looked at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I was thinking all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past have known several kinds of like this, or maybe some versions of them.
It turned out like an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was actually <unk> a little bit like fixing a problem that had the front, and it just wouldn't happen like that.
So I couldn't manage it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and about what they have to <unk> I've been better with men.
What was trying to do is <unk> those hormones and those hormones and so forth, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my <unk> of ideas.
We would think of almost always in images, and that became my point of key reference, how do you get these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> and we will get new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in similar ways.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there is a question of asking you today -- and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me, it's simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right and lots of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get these mental images of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use their imagination only to steer the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music in your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments done by two groups that were done by two groups that are made in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, image <unk> to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual while you're watching that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the central column of the left left -- it looks like the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab, in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves into the visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, he showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were monitoring their brains to create a large pool of brain reactions to the video sequences.
And then they showed them a film with new images, new animals, and as long as we get a new <unk>
So the computer using just the brain information from the scan of the scan of the scan of it to show you what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're okay near it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same picture, you think of the brain the same <unk>
This has been conducted with the <unk> <unk> systems available today, and its resolution increased as a thousand times over the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution for a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we get it?
There are lots of techniques to do that.
One is opening the skull and introduce electrodes.
I can't offer that one.
Many are proposing new projection techniques by images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- first we need to question the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> just offer small improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands of them as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets -- make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different <unk> like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really big, right?
But the majority of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions in decoding and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> radio frequency.
At once, instead of a magnetic field, the fecal field, the fecal magnetic patterns that <unk> the frequencies of <unk> radio.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing processing patterns, we can increase <unk> information that can be taken into a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers of our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood of <unk> but the <unk> of the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity. This is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas into direct form to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how are we learning to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are big questions.
It would be compelling as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open up this door.
In any case, choose a year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about this night about coming out of the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just the gay person.
I think we all have <unk>
And her must be saying to anyone for a person for the first time you love love, or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have ever gone through in life.
And all I think is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and coming out of that closet is a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave me a <unk>
And it will be slope to the <unk> of my pants <unk> and I got my <unk> my head back, I would usually ask me a child -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And he would find a awkward silence at the table.
I put my jaw a little bit longer, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, looking at her son.
But I would not say anything, and put it inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place when there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues" I <unk>
So I took a deep breath and I went down and I went down and my back and my backs a little girl with a pink dress with a pink dress with a pink <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a guy or <unk>
So I took a big breath, again, I started <unk> about it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have my short hair like a boy, and I saw a girl, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a little <unk>
Now, I am more than a girl from a <unk> <unk>
And that little girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite card is <unk> and you have a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> by <unk>
And that was everything.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hard deal of all I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different than yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons for why I get out of my closet it was harder to get out of his, but this is the <unk> It's hard not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell someone that to explain to someone who has declared bank banking is harder to say it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder to tell your five-year-old <unk>
There is no more difficult, there's only a hard thing.
We need to stop to classify what is hard to be difficult to another person to make us better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel safety, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are, a closet not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine themselves 20 years ago.
I, who had a tail, a <unk> dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight any four years that would go to the coffee.
I was frozen in <unk> <unk> in a corner of my dark closet -- my grenade grenade and move only muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers who I've spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world turned back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> they kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and by making my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally I came to one where my parents were friends from my parents, people who were known for years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Do you ever have some of you in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in St. Petersburg.
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
Do you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite book Will and Will Grace <unk>
And you know who are <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in hopes desperately to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is wearing <unk> shirts for me.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to tell where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find it, and realizing the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to do.
It's like the hard conversations still without being my strong point.
Ask anybody who has <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl in coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others have to know that we do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they are gay, right?
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be influenced by that.
And some of you can get injured safe <unk> so they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours <unk>
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find out in a dark <unk> I have to be able to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
So if you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> which "The question of whether a machine can think of is so interesting as the question if an underwater can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's step back a walk.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know anything about the Earth on Earth and the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you'd see that they would have to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until some time in time, the asteroids that are going to solve the surface of a planet's planet. They stop doing it.
And so I claim this is the same question that the understanding of the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I studied a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be successfully successfully for the development of intelligence, and in particular, to the development of universal states that will lead to the diversity of possible future.
Finally, on the planning of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all of these different topics, and we would put together together, I asked myself for several years: There's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just an equation for the <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen before.
So what you're looking at here is an affirmation that intelligence is a force -- F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, but to an impending time future <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the alternative options.
And so in mind this equation, is natural to ask, what can we do with this?
How about it?
Would you take the level of human <unk>
We were going to bring the intelligence back.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> in their life should have a tendency to more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What happens if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of <unk> but actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you can find it.
Amazingly, <unk> could be able to pass multiple animal tests -- playing human games, and even making money <unk> actions, everything without being asked to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human foot <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided for his account to balance the <unk>
This ability to have apps for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate pulling opposite lengths of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a model of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see this successfully playing a <unk> game against itself, providing their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where friends are constantly going to get together and keeps the net well connected.
This same network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> we can organize the routes of a fleet of boats, which is going to be successful and using the Panama Canal to expand the worldwide scope of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> they spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of <unk> <unk> by successfully increasing assets under changing exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is a variety of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all flow from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So back at the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if you were going to be smart machines, there would be <unk>
The machines are going on against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion -- the other way around.
It's not that machines are first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's the contrary, that the urge to take control of every possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that intelligence is actually going to arise directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask, how do you look for a goals of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to move to the descendants of them to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them to understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, over the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points around other stars, which points the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the <unk> <unk> intensity of stars when the planets go through them in front of them, and blocking a little bit of that light coming to us.
The data was picked up by Kepler -- show the sizes of planets besides the distance between them and their stem star.
And together, it helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> as the land planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their compassion to do.
Instead, this gives you clues about whether these planets find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is embedded under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hotter recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from the last year now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale -- have very rapidly <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a scientist of weather, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, hoping to find places in the universe where discover life beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I'm looking for planets like the Earth, more I enjoy our own planet.
Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world shown by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track its surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
<unk> like the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not just short space flight but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places that are actually <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and <unk> places on Earth, air is fresh and full of oxygen embedded by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this kind of excitement from the colonization of Mars and other planets across them with a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars will expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly habitable the Earth.
And so I like exploration exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for humanity -- it's like imagine that the captain of the Titanic is like imagine that the party of truth will be in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and land preservation are not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
Only you find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces.
So let me leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, physical Fermi Fermi did asked in mind that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope there were lots of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of life in life so far.
Well, where are you?
Well, one solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is protecting the origin of the planets that are going to build this development.
It's <unk> to think that only colonization we need to save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration of <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to deal with the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the best task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I put my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window in the dining table where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all pretty well closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff <unk> I had an early flight in Europe the next morning and I was <unk> from my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, in the circumstances, I had a good thing.
I'm a prisoner of a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rhythm, <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter in the airport, in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could be done, systems that could put in the place, which would be the bad things going on.
Or at least, if you happen bad things -- that you will make the probability of a total catastrophe.
So I started thinking about that, but even a month after my thoughts not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he talked about that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport. And he had forgotten with me who had been practicing something called a retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it says, <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that you might go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> other people are not so evident.
I'm going to start with <unk>
In the house, you put a place for the things that you lose easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make track of the most important things, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the <unk> trees live in where the tribes have friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find them nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they <unk> the <unk> sense of the <unk> and you still find their nuts.
They were not using smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not as good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car keys, reading and <unk>
So at home he <unk> a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport. A particular drawer on it.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it, your stuff will always be there when you get them.
What about the <unk>
Take your cell phone a picture of your credit card, licensed license, you know, you put themselves to the mail in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress is not the best moment, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there are perhaps more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, having to make a very important decision about the future of our health care or one self to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very specific medical condition.
But this is being defined as a <unk> for all of us in medical decisions, and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we have to take from the fact that we would benefit an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of infectious disease attack, heart injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most popular drugs in the world today, even you're likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for that most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit to surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And it must be thinking about what kind of statistic <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if not to help me.
But the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not your <unk> and if it's somebody's fault from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number we need to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> which what do you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the researchers called <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I would explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability on 300 of the <unk>
Why not do it <unk> <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and you have to be asked by the <unk> effects, right?
For this particular drug, the side effects produce in five percent of patients.
And those include things -- <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to go to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
And remember, under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how we do this over time, so you don't have to make the feedback chain on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get <unk> by the drug you can help you drug medicine.
I don't say they had or not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your doctor.
<unk> healthcare is part of the beginning of informed consent informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this needs to actually deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that is more done in the major men of 50, prostate cancer by cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
That's why 49 surgeries per person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if it's lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of that 50 percent of the effects of it just one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue with the conversation to go forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot more pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can switch on the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face 2 Face with a predator is not necessary or <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, they're not reacting to quickly. You might be the lunch for the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We are all going to fail sometimes.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help you minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I went to the night of <unk> in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor gave me a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered -- and lots of messages that I haven't read from it.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never hit a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little story.
The language of French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over the time they mixed up with local, and developed the language we have now known as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a <unk> world -- is as if I lived in a foreign country -- in a foreign country -- following the blind their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do I understand the computer sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of <unk> <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, you can't get it in the <unk>
This is all called the <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk> from the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for the sound of the sound, which is about coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
It's going to go on.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through <unk> subtle and <unk>
In the <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do whatever with my thumb -- it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings, I only have four lines on paper.
In 2008, 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different <unk> spaces and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend, and that called me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to care more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that we don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel I feel like tactile or this experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and get it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and care that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt the sound was <unk> it was something of a person listener.
And the sound is so powerful that I could be able to get to me and my artistic work, or I could tell me.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around speech.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, at asking you to <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I will not continue with this practice, I feel that it could be done in the forget and not having any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't capture and express on the paper.
And the same can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning of signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in a lot of different <unk>
If it's assigned a different <unk> for every finger while you're touching the piano, the facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the shape of the body, and so as you touch the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you get a key at a time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers, you need to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If only a key would change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different <unk> parameters can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see it through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign and fold it over and over again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you're wearing.
This is <unk> <unk>
If you get it, and you measure the visually speed, you see as a piece of music.
All day long.
I feel like the same thing can be said to you, the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This is how time is expressed in <unk> and how much distance to body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two <unk> the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one -- which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time -- <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Watch <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of them in high hands.
Now we're going to do it both in your head as a chest, like a <unk> or <unk> or <unk> at the same time."
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the signs of signs across the world.
The second I'd like to show you is this: Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third man, please go back again.
And again, again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest -- but they carry very different meanings of it.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> alive and <unk> just like music.
However, today, we live in a very competitive world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have a sounds, it doesn't automatically have a social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to create its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, and you don't have to hear to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to encourage you to open your ears, open your eyes, to engage in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can get in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you take them everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, which was all possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a ignorance bubble I must say, because adults lied us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I found out that the adults also had, and that they're not very good to clean up each other.
The time happened, I'm now adult and invention teaching the <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to gather those little pieces of plastic to actually look at them under the microscope, and they were <unk> and they put this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very <unk> and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So together with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a <unk>
We started to build this <unk> job <unk> so that the kids very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you, children who manipulate electrical tools are really cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of his <unk>
We do that.
I leave you my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out what we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot with robots.
And then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we would transform lights and web cameras on accessories and you put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor as the computer on board -- process this picture and measuring the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would make it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to solve the solution immediately.
I can research my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are children very well.
You see the news news, we call the Internet, and you get back with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands of the hands in <unk> the world's largest <unk> in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that they <unk> the water where the water has gone in.
You can also see that water is brown and oil and oil are also brown and when it's <unk> it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can spread across all kinds of substances that produce <unk> different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
So we set up this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to look at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was able to investigate a problem at <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe I could go a harder problem, and also address a harder problem.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that triggered several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed several cities on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power plant, close to water.
And today, according to the reports that an average of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure radiation radiation, everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast, and the majority, at the moment, is safe and blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and research successfully with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't know.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> you see the use of different <unk>
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Together with them we discussed the data back that day and talk about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent the <unk> data of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate rain.
With this, we could see that the radioactive dust will spread from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition -- the closest to nuclear power to date.
We are approaching a half miles of nuclear power, and with the fishermen help in the area -- we were collecting <unk> <unk> with a tracking device as we invented and we build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became so small therefore we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and convert it into the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with destructive energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced population transforming their standard wheelchair into new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, ordinary citizens -- creators, to prepare the next generation to worry about environment and people, so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two <unk> of radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the one of a single string of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other one would believe it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the raw, <unk> he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The <unk> was a tool for Michelangelo.
But the living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, we take all the information for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by making it and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins is thin with <unk> pores with the light-activated pore.
The skins of the back is more thick with little <unk>
One acts mostly as a filter, and it's mostly like barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that changes its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of every designer of every designer and architect to work on between the <unk> and the gene, of the machine between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere.
My work on its simplest level, it is about bringing these two visions of the world, moving away from the assembly and getting up to growth.
You might probably ask, why now?
Why couldn't this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special time in history, a weird time, where they connect four disciplines that offers designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I think we make.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools across scales, in large scale, like this robotic arm with an <unk> of diameter with a base of 24 percent <unk> and <unk> buildings, and the nanoscale <unk> made out of genetically engineered <unk> which shine in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where each opening is <unk> to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion tape with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing star <unk> we printed this layer and 3D skirt without the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an <unk> scanner as well.
That designers have access to this <unk> analytical designers that are allowed to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a chair in the comfortable structural and also that absorbs sound.
The Professor Carter -- my collaborator, we went back to nature for <unk> and by designing this <unk> surface becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> on pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, vary its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> <unk>
But is it <unk> nature.
There is no parts of nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck in and actually define a lot of what she matters.
As she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a tree, <unk> <unk>
For that first tree, it would not have any difference between trunk, and then it would have no difference between trunk, and then <unk>
The whole tree was <unk>
Instead, the land made trees grow trees with branches, <unk> water and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if objects were made out of a single part?
Would you have a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material to put the kind of material out of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million pounds produced every year by organisms like <unk> or crabs, and <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can tune into their properties, we could generate structures that would be built into a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We asked a lot of seed seed <unk> and we produced <unk> <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a broad range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, smooth and transparent.
In order to print the <unk> structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one single material -- a half a half percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, you let it dry up to find a natural shape in the air.
So why are we still designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> which came for the first time on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, the bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition with no problems of beams <unk> and if it extends even more, to windows.
A tree, <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made from shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects that are designed for <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we have to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> chart made our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- we will bring together new biological brightness into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these engineered crops.
In our first piece of clothes, it would be <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the water ponds of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns to sugar, the other burning sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution design.
To hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like <unk> tract that will help us make these bacteria and that they would take their function of way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material in the <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> we have more transparent channels.
So this <unk> digestive system is coming away from one end to another, it goes down 60 feet.
This is half of the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin <unk> our skin <unk> and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, we always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer is printing <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which it was <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which <unk> those fibers out of each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first is put in the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, are manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a tiny magnet to the head of a worm -- silk <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the cocoon of silk.
However, by putting the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that you can put a cocoon and a flat, <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different environments, different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, <unk> structure -- is transmitted directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms are <unk> the death worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates can shape raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we came up with this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk networks, and we put it in our site.
We knew the silk worms we knew all of the more dark and dark areas -- so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, turning the silk worms over the structure.
We were prepared to get <unk>
We are <unk> <unk> of silk <unk> online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to meet us with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as it was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
So by <unk> biological silk of silk <unk> they give the whole of this pavilion by integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the road route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other fills empty.
If the final frontier of design is to give life to products and buildings around us, to form a ecology of two materials, designers have to bring these two visions in the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
So here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads to a design inspired by nature inspired by nature inspired by the first time, which demands of us, for the first time, we take from nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked you, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
Can you stick with your toes.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school, I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and the arts and collected websites -- I also played the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to try and persist in every rate, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it.
But then I went to the other thing, and something totally different, and I would focus on it, and I let myself absorb and feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my own passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason I caused so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something bad about me is not <unk> at all.
I was worried to be afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did it, they learned from culture.
We ask first, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what you belong to that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk>
So this question gets us over and over again as we grow in different ways, you have to go to high school students, you ask the question you're going to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, it's not inspired by dreaming of whatever they might be.
In fact, it's just the contrary, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer 20 different things, even though they are good <unk> they may be <unk> and say, "Oh, what's cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor was turned on in <unk> <unk> teacher and creative conductor.
But most kids are not hearing about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of <unk> life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of <unk> or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What happens if there are a lot of different issues that wake up your curiosity and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel it.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many creative interests and activities.
It's a breath for that.
It could help if you divide it into three parts: a lot of potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
For the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> one of your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned from talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being this way.
Here are three superpowers
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> its shared interests in terms of data, and to travel, mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
And Rachel <unk> came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
Out of the new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second <unk> superpower, is learning fast.
When we were <unk> we go into something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because it's been many times in the past, and this means we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area that <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and independent writer.
As a young pianist was an amazing ability to develop muscle cake.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before to become a writer, he was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when his practices, and this ability helps to write the compelling tea for the editors.
<unk> is a waste of time to have a waste of time to do what you're going to ask you, even if you finally read it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third <unk> superpower, is the adaptability.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes a director of individual videos, and sometimes a web designer designer from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes apparently James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
The Company <unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the market needs, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas -- quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you might lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> <unk> knowing what they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into a depth and put in ideas and <unk> it provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that we can do with the way we're connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in large part of them will tell you to just be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there is one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with your inner wiring whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist then <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized to be one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep your curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
They put the intersections.
So our internal wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I took a woman called <unk> they carried it to a psychiatric psychiatric failure.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more surprising.
If you were to have been living today, we couldn't give her more help than she <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has been a lot.
They have figured out antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But recently it has been progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, will include many of you.
If you wait to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each other.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you spend your teenage years from Alzheimer's disease or helping to take care of a friend or be dear Alzheimer's disease.
Already in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs <unk> an increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's other than other diseases because we spend less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times every year in cancer research than in Alzheimer's cancer in spite of the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and cause a similar annual number of deaths as cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people know, but the whole <unk> world is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us even, scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy human brain, compared to the heart of an Alzheimer's patient to see real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to spark a severe memory of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plate and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that's folding as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's brain.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and identifying what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
You can do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that is doing it.
Until recently, most of them have reduced wires and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now is testing a new kind of drugs that cosmic specifically this way to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see some videos of what happened to the test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have these protein molecules that stick itself into each other, like humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see it <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial initial result, but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope that can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to assume that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and if we do it, we can make it <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry, drug industry.
That was essential to move forward into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit today to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimers is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I put this article in the middle love column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The paper is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience as well as we try to try it back a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers will be <unk> to get 36 more and more personal questions and then both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or something, what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time you would send yourself to someone else?
And <unk>
<unk> these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number four: I really loved me <unk> your partner -- what would you like from him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave them things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited to all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well -- I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the loving column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking, are they still going on?
And the reason I think it's questioning this is because you've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been asking myself to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and I thought that my paper in the New York Times would probably have a few thousands of view.
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But it had no idea.
The paper was published on Friday at night, and on Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I already had called the "Today <unk> and "Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the paper received over eight million pages, and I was like, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust by writing honestly about own <unk> experiences -- but another thing is to discover that a loving life of one has international news --  -- and the people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: still get together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick pursuit of my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared right away.
They were students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed by radio and <unk>
I still gave a talk, and a woman screamed down to stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article called <unk> for St. <unk> which included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very close with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both make a public play together.
I read television interviews, and I would give <unk> orders from us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study would work, they wanted to know if it was actually able to be able to produce love, not just an adventure, but a real, real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially the wrong question.
How do you know if we were to put together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions at this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for <unk> approach, among university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds like romantic, right?
But the study worked.
The participants were felt closer after doing -- several later studies, they also used international protocol <unk> <unk> as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it in between members of police and community, and they've used it among people in opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately they never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed to be grateful for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you would get away from the person who will do it.
Well he <unk>
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, but better friends?
<unk> that I know they managed to get better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation here.
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to almost all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I took to the science of science.
And I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that to be able to sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I was just working for the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was shocked by the knowledge of romantic love, I never would have to feel as bad and used to feel so bad, and I used to feel as bad as I sat back then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I think.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably they can demand me.
What I look for about love is an assurance -- not just being <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to remain <unk> indefinitely for the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very controversial story, because fall in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that I ask, still follow together?
And his content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's ask ourselves to make more difficult, questions like, How you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to cut out and get it to <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? or even more, how live your <unk>
I don't necessarily know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of my life story -- it's <unk> a year ago, a known year and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we continue to continue -- still together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my journal <unk> Love didn't happen.
You have fallen in love with fallen in love because we take the choice of itself.
And I sort of <unk> a little bit, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was no thought of everything that that kind of choice.
I didn't think of how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want to be enough to have done and responded with 36 questions, having chosen to love someone that was so generous, kind and fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what I'm going to do, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is going to be true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my item, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by <unk> and <unk> in a way I got a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York makes a time.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and it would take a dollar, you know, a dollar, and a fork and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some weird <unk> or some aliens could find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it has a grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a time I was in <unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and all of those <unk> things and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> I was attached to the Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of the bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of a way that it seemed like it grew as size, as if it were to be able to pass the text with a <unk>
So I did do that? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements and frogs that I started to add electronic elements that I could find out the street -- everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out the stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow out -- I can flow just like you get around a dead body in the crime scene.
And I took out of the objects and I created my own <unk> specimens
First of all, you think that you can get an idea.
And then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was so much fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size, with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was hooked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets like a window in a window, then in another window and another window window, and he had all of these windows together that make a three-dimensional mindset.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very large, that I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> mesh where it <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals with animals are heading to <unk> lists for suicide -- in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a dead god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand, while the other hand is coming out of it.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird peak.
It also has a <unk> tail of the snake that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail is <unk> by <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eyeball made from the terrorist cards in 1986.
They have <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were to be baseball baseball cards in the terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a two-year project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in the form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they come together, they get together.
And you can walk between them. It's bringing me up.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 kilos with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> his chest, you can hide the entrance.
I will see you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall who comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has -- a kind of thing that was <unk>
It's a quick practice of these works because I can't get it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see it.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There's some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a <unk> an editorial arm that broadcasts all the content we do in the world and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all of the people inside it strikes each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get <unk> who is and the box that is living on.
And together we came to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion of which we are different, these concepts of countries, of the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very facts from the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't begin to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
You take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any medicines will be actually effect on your body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug will be broken.
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they have to decrease the amount of virus in your blood, and increase the stem cell counts by <unk>
But they are also known by their side effects that are going on very much of negative, because in the time that it takes to reach the current current will be <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to reach its destiny, which is where it's more important -- in the malaria storage is.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go in the blood flow of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after treatment, the virus can awaken and infect new cells <unk>
This is the great issue of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life being run by the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the virus, the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for wounded care and surgery surgery, can be used for anything, including transportation drug transportation.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or <unk> extremely small holes, open up and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people say, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small laser and very powerful laser beam on the cellular membrane while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser passes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before they even notice, the hole is actually <unk>
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to take this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it runs to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes it directly into the place of infection, as the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to HIV eradication of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the <unk> dream dream in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging violent participation to violent <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace agreements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we should even be <unk> or <unk> in any research process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they make it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the political struggle are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also set a political party, a network of social services and a military device.
Likewise, the Palestinian Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
<unk>
So we had a complex machinery of communication stations channels, television channels and strategies on social networks.
And here's the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to make better and build their brand.
<unk> are also doing something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, put in professional training programs.
<unk> provides all these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state will not harm security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can be able to see the efforts of these groups by providing security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a foreign price price for the population.
But in general, to provide social services means filling up a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006, Palestinian Hamas cannot understand the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at groups <unk> we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps <unk> by government, and emerge as armed and political groups, participate in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more sophisticated and sophisticated ones are these organizations, we less can make them feel like something like a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory running all its function, collect the trash handle the system of <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of <unk> nations without state and hybrids and the more weak states, the more states, as in the Middle East, and they fill that gap the actors of non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more on their tools.
<unk> that vacuum of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and <unk> peace.
If we understand the groups better than the groups -- we will understand better what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors -- the military power can win some battles, but not giving us peace and stability.
To get these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety of safety, to fill that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I am a failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My views of gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the tag tag -- it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I became a bad feminist thing.
Or, at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> sex.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to say that could be a feminist person.
It will be labeled as feminist was a <unk> a word, taboo and unpleasant.
I was inspired as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
He would play the same paycheck for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as well as <unk> <unk>
We have a right to use easy to use the contraceptives and the services <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing <unk> or abstruse <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, gender, religion and our social condition, our social condition, and much more.
We have to have into account these differences and how we engage ourselves in the same way that matters in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist thing.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music at all volume.
Although the letter degrades in women and offends me, the classic <unk> classic <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry isn't it?
I'm completely <unk> for my musical recognition.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
It was <unk> from fashion magazines, and good things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I accepted that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's get this problem.
<unk> conventional feminism has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, gay and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> women -- <unk> and high class.
Listen, if that's a good feminism is a very bad feminist picture.
It also happens to be the following: As a feminist, I feel so much pressure.
We have this tendency to put feminists in a <unk>
We expect it to be able to fit perfection.
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider that <unk> before you try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yeah, I'm a fear of fear of what it means to be that tag for fear of not being able to be able to fulfill the unlikely expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years is a feminist feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this star <unk> embrace openly looking at feminism and make women and young men who become feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics began a specific debates if we were to <unk> or not a feminist thing.
He would take his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
We have perfection of <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so <unk>
We go much beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to <unk> the action and be a little <unk>
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way of talking about women in their songs until they <unk> the change affecting change actually affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions do this that makes it harder for women to make equality, gender equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
It's two <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant girls and also very brave. I want them to grow up in a world.
Where they were being told by strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice is going to become a lot more easy to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sex violence against women like sport, <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk> <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his magazine, participating in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also recognize it to be even more until more like us are forcing us to overcome the barriers to the decision.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions come to the top, to people in power directors, and movie producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell ourselves with courage -- good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> to be a bad feminist to not be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you about everything, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids were passionate about when I was very young, and I didn't know kids can do this to a girl.
They tried to be nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all, I don't believe myself to believe that it could matter.
But -- I was writing.
And then I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and invention I also found that if I was a little brave another woman could hear me and see me and see that none of us is nothing that the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And on the other, I make the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope we can all be a little courageous, when more you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because they had visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be fatal to a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the most easily horrific diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than over half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the outbreak of the outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> still with autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that sparked the argument about autism and vaccines and <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud for the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still making sure that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it was to develop all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued to stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
NGOs like <unk> organizations refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control from Atlanta what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnosis, and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks on the face of his son of two years, visual contact.
If the criteria of diagnostic had to be <unk> why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were these cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science than with the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story was discovered, but the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article which describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private worlds -- <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by shaking their hands before their faces, but they were prey to panic as when he didn't stand his favorite toy in its usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients on their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, the main authority of the world in the subject, declared that there had seen less than 150 true cases of its syndrome as far as distant from places as distant South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, we can give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine of 10 children to her office for being autistic and not giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> caused by cold fathers and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have kept in a refrigerator that I didn't know.
At the same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that are clustering in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills affirming things like children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to earn their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for the families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought the theory of welfare mothers was pretty stupid.
She and her husband were John <unk> and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as without a support services, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Service Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What they saw was very clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse in Mexico.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in beautiful <unk> and <unk> as he said <unk> and they saw a lot more of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody have noticed these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then they were going to be buried in buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> throw it in his own work.
There was not even a translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> husband was German, and he <unk> it for her.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic integrated with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic, they started with music exercises with music, and the kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as being <unk> <unk> of life that needed <unk> forms of support and spaces like the whole of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, <unk> called them their small teachers, and it was starting to help in the development of education methods that were particularly suited for them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse diverse that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disabilities.
He believed that autism and the autistic traits were common, and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, a hint of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that I was wrong with autism that autism was <unk> so the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silently with the American Association of <unk> to expand the <unk> criteria that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s, their changes came into <unk> by <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and inclusive.
These changes didn't fall into broken <unk>
<unk> when I was <unk> and Judith worked among these <unk> people from all over the world to see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out with <unk> <unk> in 1988, only a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> acting <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> with four awards from <unk> <unk> psychologists, teacher and parents around the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, these first clinical trials were introduced to use to diagnose autism.
It no longer had to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that so that the people with autism and their families finally would bring the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> got to blame vaccines for the increase in the <unk> and a powerful one, and it <unk> and <unk> history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention that one of every 68 children in the United States are right in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that these puzzles are going to solve for new medical breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding the teachers, employers with capacity, community communities communities, and parents with faith in the potential for their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We once said, "We have all the hands on deck for <unk> the <unk>
As we move towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to afford a brain.
Thank you.
